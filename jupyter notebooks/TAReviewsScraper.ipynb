      "review_body : To those traveling to the West Bank, be advised that firstly, the culture will be shocking for those who have never been to the Middle East before. It's quite extreme in terms of outside surroundings, even for someone coming from Israel. The standards of this hotel however, do match up with some of the more run-down establishments in the west. Not that the hotel wasn't comfortable, because it was. There was a nice flat panel TV in the room, the bed was comfortable, the room clean, and overall, the staff was very friendly. There were a few problems and for this reason I personally wouldn't go back to to the hotel based on them. They are as follows: The first night of my stay I wanted to take a bath. When I turned the water on, I noticed there was no plug, so I went to phone reception. When I did so, the phone would not call down to the lobby. I had to go downstairs by elevator - which was another irritant to everyone in our group, because the elevator stopped on every single floor even when no one pushed the button. When I reached the ground floor, I told the receptionist the problem with their being no bathtub stopper. For a long time I didn't believe she understood me in English, because she said they didn't have them in the hotel - and that seemed absurd to me. She then finally called the manager, and he confirmed that they in fact do not have bathtub stoppers in the rooms because there is never enough hot water. That would have been a culture shock, only if I had thought for a moment that The Intercontinental down the street might have had the same problem. Which I highly doubt they did/ever do. Then came later that evening, when the phone started working and I called down to have them send up some extra pillows - plus the heater in the room wasn't working and it was freezing. They said someone would be up shortly. A half an hour later, I called down again and the same girl said they were on their way and would be up in five minutes. Another half hour passed, and I called down again only to be told by a man, that he didn't know about any pillows being sent up and in a rather curt tone said, \"We probably don't have any.\" And then hung up. I fell asleep around midnight, and shortly thereafter there was a knock at the door - two hours after I'd originally called downstairs. A rather unpleasant man, who didn't even seem like he belonged on staff, had pillows in his hand and handed them to me. When I thanked him, I asked him to come in and look at the heater. He fiddled with the remote for about twenty seconds then threw it down on the bed and said, \"I don't know how it works. You have to ask someone else.\" And then walked out the door. The other thing that is important to note about the hotel, is that you can hear ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that is going on outside your door. It's very loud and you feel as though you are in someone's home, rather than a hotel. There is absolutely no sound proof anything going on. My group was there for a conference, so there were over a hundred of us, kids in tow, and you could hear everything in the hallways. I really, really hated that. That's something to definitely factor in if you're considering staying at this hotel.At 5:15 in the morning we were serenaded (note the sarcasm) with Mosque music, and while I understand that's not the hotel's fault, they could have perhaps had better insulation in the windows. While there was no bath for two nights, the heater worked only the second night after one of my roommates managed to figure it out, and there was this run-in with delayed service and an indifferent attitude - I do have to admit that the rest of the staff was very friendly, pleasant and accommodating. I would say though that if given the choice of where to stay, this wouldn't be my first pick as it's not the nicest of places. There was a large buffet of food for dinner, and as far as I know for breakfast as well. Salads, Middle Eastern delicacies galore were all a part of the restaurant's menu both days we were there. I didn't have any of the food provided - but was told by my friends that it was delicious. The towels provided are small and rough. They are not soft at all - imagine shop towels, but less comfortable. They are almost grainy. There were three of us staying in a room (naturally two of the twin beds were pushed together - why, God only knows), and they gave us two tiny bars of soap. All in all I wouldn't deny that this is a comfortable enough establishment, but once again, just not my very first choice. P.S. There was also no toilet brush in the bathroom - just a good tip for you, depending on how you roll.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed in this hotel during our visit in Bethlehem and the place is really nice esp we have the spacious room on the 4 floor with the excellent view of the sorrounding area of the old town. The hotel looks very simple outside but the staff is friendly with good service and they have maintained the cleanliness in the good standard. I cant find any fault as most of the facilities is relatively good. Food is also good which is being serve in 2 restaurants with a lots of variety to choose from. Overall a nice experience and I do recommend this place if you want close to the old town and accessible to the important areas of Catholic or Christian pilgrimage.\n",

      "review_body : I went to the hotel with my wife and my 3 children for 2 nights on Easter. The hospitality was great and the hotel is located well within the center so we could walk into the old city and the marketplace by foot.We were located on the 5th floor while the rooms were relatively clean the windows were so dirty that we could not see the view without opening them! In addition the windows could not be shut and feared for the children so we asked them not to go too close to the windows!The parking lot of the hotel is relatively small (only around 10 cars could cramp into the small parking lot of the hotel and we had to ask to move the cars in order to go in/out of the parking lot. (it was not that bad as most of the time we did not have to use the car at all)The TV/entertainment in the hotel is almost not present (the TVs only have a few channels) so bring something for the kids to do (while bathing, etc.)Overall we had a good experience, in order to make it better I suggest to fix/clean the windows, get better children entertainment and improve the parking lot.\n",

I felt safe the entire time and was treated fairly and just. It was a good experience. The only negative was that the wi-fi service was a little sketchy at times and passing through the checkpoints took some time in the morning. Overall it was a good experience.\n",

Spacious rooms many with good views. Good food provided in 2 restaurants. Located close to the old town of Bethlehem and an easy walk through the markets to the Church of the Nativity. A very good option for staying in Bethlehem and supporting the local economy. Bethlehem has much to 'take in' and enjoy.\n",

      "review_body : The Shepherd Hotel is a convenient and comfortable hotel. You will experience warmth and professional hospitality from the Palestinians at the hotel. Nothing is too much trouble. The food is first class and the proportions are very generous. The rooms are well-appointed and of a good size. Finally, you have ease of access from the hotel to the Church of the Nativity and to the local shops. This was my first trip to Bethlehem and I fet that 'The Shephed Hotel' was a good choice. If you wish to dine elsewhere there are a number of small restaurants and cafes near by. The only 'down side' of Bethlehem is the evidence of apartheid in the form of the monstrous wall that has been constructed. As a boy I once saw the Berlin Wall and the wall that the Israelis have contructed is just as disturbing a sight. What a pity that there is no John Kennedy standing up for the plight of the Palestinians in the way he did for Berliners.\n",

      "review_body : Situated close to the centre of Bethlehem but on a quiet sidestreet, this hotel is cool and comfortable. The staff are very obliging and helpful. Always willing to please. The hotel has a sort of faded elegance - when staying here you will become part of the local community. A couple of doors down the road is the local bakery where, from the early hours, they hand-bake bread with a cheery smile and a wave. The local street market is bustling with local charm and everyone is so welcoming. A ten minute stroll though the souk will take you to Nativity Square.The rooms are comfortable with air-con, shutters, comfortable beds and a little bit of luxury. The food is local fare - which adds to the ambience. If you want to immerse yourself in the local culture while being comfortable then this is the place for you. We have stayed there twice and will happily return again.\n",

Due to the apartheid wall it's not possible for locals to go to Israel and income from tourist is important in these parts. Stayed here for 3 nights, good food, loads of salad selection, they have a lot of group tourist as well so it could be busy at the restaurant certain times. Free unlimited fast wifi, this was helpful as I used to skype home. Alcohol served at the bar.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed here because our tour director wanted our group to spend some of our tourist dollars in hotels, restaurants and gift shops in the West Bank, where commerce is needed badly. The Shepherd hotel was nice, but not a modern, glitzy hotel, though the bathrooms were entirely fresh and modern. The room was spacious with very nice beds, and a little old-fashioned in decor. The food was fine, expecially the dinner. OUr group gathered in the lounge before dinner where the barman was both friendly and appreciative of our business and it was a very pleasant time for us. The wi-fi was free, the only time we got it free in an 11-day tour of Israel. I liked the attitude of the management and staff.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed here for eight nights with a group of Pax Christi Austria on our Pilgrimage Tour when we tried to visit many local people engaged in work for peace and justice. We liked the place in its tranquility and special atmosphere just beside the Carmel where Mariam Baouardy, the first palestinian Saint lived after she herself initiated this Carmel.The food is excellent, rich and full of choice, every night something new special. The breakfast is simple but enough to start a good day. The rooms are clean and good enough for a good sleep after a full day of work in the olive yard of Daoud Nasser (Tent of Nations). The view is beautiful. The lounge invites to sit in the evening with a good Tabeyh beer or Cremisan wine from the Salesian brothers.The staff is helpful and friendly, trying the find solutions for every special need.Of course you can find many facts which make a difference to a Five Star Hotel! But thats exact the difference! Its no Five Star Hotel, but a good and innovative place to meet people from the area, to experience their life and problems and give them a chance to earn money. Staying here means helping the Caritas in their work and rising Bethlehems economy. So you get a moderate room with excellent food for a very reasonable price! The more people stay here, the larger the chance for renovations which of course could do some good. Maybe the busdriver needs some special advise, as our bus driver didn’t know the place.Ask for Fr. Raed the Director of Caritas Jerusalem who started this guesthouse and you will learn a lot about life in Bethlehem. They are very thankful for every stay!\n",

Remote location - Not in proximity of markets/shops or restaurants. Rooms are good, but not quite big. Linen was clean and changed as per request. Breakfast fare was not very large but good mix of vegies and sausages and eggs with pita bread. Plus point is staff very courteous and helpful. Shower space in our room was almost minuscule. Not at all enough to take a decent shower. Overall, a good value for money - budget hotel. Serves very well, the purpose of pilgrim groups who need a good, clean, quiet place after a day’s tiring sightseeing.\n",

It is located 25 minutes walking from Manger Square and the Nativity Church or a short, cheap taxi ride. Breakfast was fine. Wifi working well. Had some issues with cold water in the shower, but did not bother to ask the staff (which by the way was nice).I would recommend staying here.

      "review_body : After trying two other places I moved here and never looked back. The staff couldn't be more helpful, yet never at any point imposed. They gave good advice to my questions and seemed to enjoy helping too. I thought the room was lovely and was happy with the heating, TV and layout, it was also kept immaculate throughout my stay. They have two or three news channels that are in English. Breakfast was just right and the fellow there transformed my whole trip for the better when I told him my interests and he advised me of an event I knew nothing of later that day. Everyone is professional and the whole package beat everywhere else I'd been hands down. Very good value and I'll be back.Tip: If you need a taxi get the hotel staff to order it for you and tell you exactly what to pay. If you don't and they see you are a tourist it will probably be ten times or more higher.\n",

      "review_body : This hotel is one of four hotels we occupied during our Jordan/Israel group tour. The courtyard as you enter the hotel is a welcome sight with a bridge leading to the entrance. The lobby is also nice and spacious. The rooms are clean and well-maintained although there is no wifi most of the time. The wifi in the lobby is more reliable. The buffet breakfasts and dinners at the restaurant are better than in the other hotels where we stayed. However, the restaurant normally opens at 7 which is too late for our early morning tours. Our tour guide requested an earlier breakfast the next day and the manager accommodated our request. Good location although we did not have time to go around on our own due to our hectic group schedule.\n",

Although one morning they woke us up one and a half hours earlier by mistake and we lost our sleep. Not so clean as one towel and one of the pillows were dirty. Breakfast was very poor and the quality of the products was bad. It was the same every day. As for the place, it is close to restaurants and to a super market( be careful in the market, they thieve you when you pay in euros) and a 10-15 minute walk from the Church of the Nativity. The bar in the 7th floor has a great view and reasonable-for the place- prices.\n",

      "review_body : My wife and I were traveling with a group of pilgrims to see mostly sites of interest to Christians. All arrangements were made through Educational Opportunities travel service as a package so I am unable to comment on room costs. My wife and I had a suite and the room was clean. We had several meals at the hotel restaurant and the food and service were good. It rained during most of our stay so we didn't walk around the city around our hotel but the spire for the church of the nativity was visible from our window and looked to be only a few blocks away. We felt safe throughout our stay but there was always a collection of street vendors waiting outside the hotel when we left or returned. The vendors are very persistent so please be courteous but firm in declining their wares - if you are not interested. Don't touch anything or they will cling to you. Also it is apparently not customary to provide a top sheet in Palestine, just a mattress cover sheet and blanket. Wash cloths are also not provided nor did the hotel staff know what a wash cloth/face cloth is. Electrical outlets are few. Had to unplug something to charge cell phone. Hotel staff were courteous and responsive to our requests.\n",

There was also a great view of the city from the room. I was skyping with my daughter and her sons (ages 3 and 5).

Also the tables in the dining room are really jam-packed and elbow room is at a premium!One thing I feel the management should look at is the lifts.

Simply but cozy. I was open the window and see the panorama of Bethlehem. I enjoyed the sunrise in every morning also I was lucky to see the sunset. I got WIFI in the room and it was free. Great ! It was help me to handle my work during my trip. All of hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I love the chair near from lift. The ornament was so feminine, warm and very eye catching with pink flower and white background. Plus !The location around 20 minutes walking from Nativity Church. You can visit some souvenir store near from the hotel also.\n",

My suggestions for improvement are the lighting in the rooms was not sufficient (no overhead light and only two small lamps for a large room.) Also, while the hotel staff was very friendly, some employees were smoking in the lobby area.\n",

Caters for international pilgrims, with a plentiful and wide buffet choice at breakfast and dinner. The staff try very hard to cater to your every whim but please remember that they are under occupation and Palestinians cannot leave the West Bank for training in hospitality in the same way that we could go to College for such training, be apprenticed to a chef or hotel or fast food chain, etc. The staff aren't as polished as those of an equivalent hotel in the West, but how on earth could they be since they aren't permitted to leave the West Bank and thus haven't had the educational opportunities that we have? Please give this hotel your custom because its rooms are well equipped, very comfortable and convenient for Bethlehem, Jerusalem and the surrounding areas.\n",

      "review_body : In June 2014, I travelled with a group of friends to Bethlehem to take part in the Bet Lahem Live Festival. All of the contributors stayed in the Grand Park Hotel. Firstly I should add that the West Bank area has probably the most well known tourist sites in the world, but really do not get as many tourists visit as they should. Bethlehem and Jerusalem are tourist gems and should not be missed. I stayed hear for just five days and the staff were so hospitable and keen to make sure that we were comfortable. We had buffet breakfasts and lunches provided which was reasonably good but probably needed a little more variety (hence not being awarded 5 stars). The rooms however were extremely comfortable and I was very happy during my stay. I would stay again and bethlehem is now one of my favourite cities in the world and Palestinians are now my favourite people! The countryside is stunning! If you have never been before, do not let the Israeli Occupation put you off going. I never felt uncomfortable being amongst Palestinians. They want (need) you to visit. Miss this experience and you will forever not see the truth of how wonderful the West Bank is.\n",

One concern was the room was very dark. This made it very hard for us to do anything that needed light. I hope they would add more lamps or lights. This room badly needs it. Free Wifi!Food is average. Location is ok. If you use the other entrance, there's a shawarma place beside it and a small grocery across the street.The staff are very pleasant and friendly.

The amenities are also quite good.One of the couples in our group had a few complaints about the cleanliness of their room, but the staff were quick to respond and fix things. Overall, staff were quite efficient and friendly.The food was buffet style, and the variety, quantity and quality on offer was excellent, especially if you like middle eastern food. The only issue if any was that there was very little change from day to day.\n",

      "review_body : I stayed at the Paradise Hotel for 4 nights. It is a lovely hotel where people take care of all needs if you ask for help and advice. It is largely catering to pilgrim tours but I travelled as a solo woman. I found the hotel well located, clean and comfortable. The food is really good and caters to many tastes.It is an historical and family owned hotel and when you stay here you are benefiting the Palestinian economy. Tourism is important to Bethlehem and Palestine so please think about spending your tourists money locally to benefit the local community who need this. The family ownership means that you receive real hospitality as a respectful visitor and you can really connect to a beautiful place.The Paradise Hotel isn't Paradise in truth, but it makes a cice and inexpensive safe haven to visit the holy city and to meet the local people. I recommend it on your next visit to Bethlehem and surrounds.\n",

Excellent food, and very diverse. Both were included in the room price. Very large meal serving area, downstairs and ground floor. Very polite and friendly staff. Asked questions about safety, food and drinks options, gave them straightforward and accurately. Very good area for safety, shopping and grocery stores. Try the local produce, exquisite. May use shekels and USD, but shekels rule. Definitely return. \n",

The newer section is very comfortable, clean and quiet. We were on the top floor, 5th and had a balcony. We ate breakfast and dinner, buffet style, at the hotel. The food was very good and nothing fancy. Come as you are, no need to dress up. The servers were friendly and helpful identifying different items. It is inside the wall and plan to visit places inside the wall to make your visit easier. Tour buses have no problem going thru the checkpoint. There was no concern walking around at night.\n",

The location is not so interesting and there is nothing around except a big souvenir shop right across the street. Our tour guide reassured us that this is a safe neighborhood and the hotel is owned by Christian Palestinians. The staff was friendly and helpful. The reception and restaurant areas were very clean and adequate, nothing special but I suppose as good as you are likely going to get in the area. The quality and variety of the lunch buffet was also very good. The food was delicious and well-cooked and I actually tried some of the best pitta bread ever.

      "review_body : I encourage all travelers to stay here. This is a hotel owned and operated by Christian Palestinians. If you really want to understand the current state of Israel....you need to stay in the occupied territories and experience what it is like for over half the population. The hotels will make your stay impeccable, while all the work force goes home at night to sub-standard living conditions. Meaning, they will sacrifice their own water intake, their standard of living...to make you feel welcome. This hotel is SAFE. I've stayed here multiple times. There is nothing wrong with the \"environment\"...other than Bethlehem is under occupation. The hotel cannot remove the separation wall. Be attentive when you travel to educate yourself past what the newspapers might report. What is the reason all the houses in Occupied Territories have water tanks on the roofs while no water tanks are found in other regions of Israel?? I have walked alone, as a woman, throughout many towns in the Occupied Territories and have never once felt unsafe. In fact, more often than not....a Palestinian has helped me find what I needed to find or directed me to a good place to shop or eat. If you find it a \"hassle\" to be asked into a shop...ask yourself how you would do under occupation in conducting your own business. I am fortunate enough that my children don't have to sell necklaces on the street. As far as the hotel...it is safe, clean, and they will knock themselves out to make your stay comfortable. You are also close to the Shepherds Field, the Church of the Nativity and 6 miles from Jerusalem.\n",

      "review_body : I stayed in a twin room for one night only. The room was very comfortable, the bed was comfortable and the room was sizeable enough. There was a TV which did have at least one English film on. The bathroom was nice, no bath but the shower was good.We had an evening meal the night I stayed. It was buffet style, lots of choice and very tasty. We also had breakfast in the morning and this was good also, mainly European continental.You have to pay for wifi, and it was a bit extortionate so it was a good job I had 3G (phone signal was a little intermittent but good for the most part). It's a good 10 minute walk from the centre of Bethlehem, but then again apart from the Church of the Nativity there's not very much in Bethlehem. It's in the Palestinian Territory so it's very Arabic rather than Jewish, and walking around you get hassled a lot like you would in a souq in Cairo.\n",

      "review_body : Paradise Bethlehem was the last stop of our trip in Jordan and Israel as a part of organized vacation. The hotels we stayed at were chosen in advance from the travel agency.We stayed for two nights in the beginning of March 2016.We arrived at the hotel in the evening. Accommodation was quick. As we came we were told that the wi-fi is paid and for only one devise!!! Very unacceptable!!! At least there should be free wi-fi in the lobby, but no!We were given a room in the new wing. The room itself is big, everything inside is new. The bed is not a double, but two singles put together. Very uncomfortable mattress - couldn’t sleep well both nights. The AC is not central, each room has its own – not a good position of the AC – above the bed! No safe in the room! Bathroom was nice and very clean. There are no personal toiletries – just two dispensers – one next to the sink, and the other in the shower.Food at the dinner buffet was average! Limited variety and quantity! Salads were not fresh, very strange soup, not a good rice. The main course was very tasty – chicken breast and white fish! No desserts!!! The first night they gave us a couple of tangerines per person, and the second night – pears! Personnel in the restaurant could be more polite. On each table they put a jug of water. The other drinks are paid. Breakfasts are also nothing special. Overall – if was up to me, I would pick another hotel…\n",

      "review_body : I am writing this review from the perspective of an American visiting Bethlehem for the first time. I found this hotel met all of my needs. The food was efficient but not spectacular. The rooms were spacious - comparable to most American hotels. Towels were tough and stiff but plenty were provided and changed daily. Front staff were friendly and spoke English well enough. The one major annoyance was paying for wi-fi that being said it was only $5 for four days. Near the walls with friendly shops nearby. Will stay here again.\n",

Staff kept refilling the dishes so there was plenty to eat. Varieties of salads, chicken, meat and a fish dish. All buffet style. struggled as both were slowly cooked meat in sauce/gravy, with either rice or potatoes. We had a bottle of wine between 4 of us plus there was water on the table. The restaurant was very clean and so were the loos.\n",

      "review_body : Went there as part of a group, travelling exclusively to places of religious (christian) interest. The location of the hotel is convenient for that, because it is as close as it gets to the entrance of Bethlehem, thus the checkpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem (and the bus stop for the local transportation bus to Jerusalem). So the group's bus didn't get stuck in traffic (finding a queue in the checkpoint is a different story), which made it easier to travel from and to Bethlehem. The main avenue of the city, Manger Street, passes in front of the hotel. However, this means that the hotel is situated in the north edge of the city, so a bit far from the city center and its main attraction, the Church of Nativity. Not particularly recommended to go there on foot, as it will be a bit tiring to return, however if you like walking a good idea would to be to go to the Church of Nativity via Manger street and return via Star street, a picturesque stone paved road.Generally the hotel is not luxurious, however I suppose this must be quite common in the West Bank. The room was quite spacious but basic, clean and generally we didn't have any particular problem. The walls are a bit thin, usually in the corridor one could hear people talking inside the rooms. Prayers from the mosques might wake you up at night if you are not used to travelling in muslim countries. Each room has one key for the door (no card), all keys are left in a basket at the reception and anyone can go and pick up his key on his own from the basket, which made me feel a bit unsafe to be honest. So I wouldn't recommend leaving valuable things unlocked in the room, I kept my luggage locked at all times while I was away from the room. There was no free wifi in the hotel, you have to pay for it per day. Some main satellite channels were available on TV. There is a buffet restaurant in the ground floor, unfortunately cuisine was rather international (obviously due to the fact that there are groups of pilgrims from all over the world staying at the hotel), so I can't say we had the chance to taste local dishes. The staff was polite and helpful. There is a small mini-market shop right next to the hotel, very convenient for buying water and snacks, from early morning till late at night.Generally it is a quite nice, convenient place to stay if you are travelling with a group (or alone, if you are planning on visiting Jerusalem frequently) but is doesn't have anything particular to offer apart from the basics.\n",

      "review_body : This hotel in Bethlehem was the closest to good international standards of the 3 in which we stayed during our visit to Israel and Palestine. I understand that the interior is being revamped and I must confess that it appeared in good order though I did not explore beyond the first floor.Our allocated room was of a reasonable size with comfortable beds and both it and the bathroom were very clean.The evening meal was again buffet-style in a large dining room. Many of the tables were marked as reserved for parties from all quarters of the globe, but we were in early and got first dibs at the food on offer. It was prepared to a very good standard, and as usual with buffets, you could go back repeatedly until you burst. No-one actually went that far while we were there.So why only four stars? Well, the waiters were obviously preoccupied and not very communicative. They dished out watermelon desert on a 'take it or leave it\" basis. Well, everyone is entitled to an off-lay I guess, and maybe they will be better next time.Breakfast was pretty good too, though our relatively early start meant that I only saw it through bleary eyes. Check-out was fast and efficient.We would stay there again, hopefully for a little longer than our one night fleeting visit.\n",

Average beds, average pillows. Furnishing and walls pretty old, like from 80-90th years but nothing too scary. There is bath and toilet in the room. In the buildings there are elevators. I didn't like food but may be it's my problem as I saw others ate like horses :) Window view is a construction site nearby and town up the hill. Around 3 a.m. Muslim prayers was heard but not for long. Walls between rooms were thin and you can easily hear your neighbours.\n",

Elevators are rather busy and my room was on 4th floor. Anyway, I used to take the stairs. The stairs are little bit narrow. The restaurant downstairs is quite busy and sometimes you have to wait in a queue at the buffet tables. There is a free wi-fi not only in the lobby, but also in the room which is not very common in the Israeli and Palestinian hotels. Overall, the hotel is good. But the beds are AS HARD AS A ROCK! Imagine lying the whole night on a marble desk. This is exactly how the beds feel. You can get used to it, but the first night is quite a shock!\n",

Room was nice sized for single person. The staff were all very helpful and accommodating. Two elevators meant short wait. Location was good with shopping close by. Taxis to Manger Square were 20-40 shekels depending on driver. No metered taxis--Work on negotiation only.

      "review_body : Paradise Hotel is in tiny Bethlehem, where you can feel all the activity in the neighborhood. It seems that it is geared for pilgrims to the Holy Land, and they are used to the volume, coming and going. It is very clean and modern. There is wifi as well in the room. The staff go out of their way to help you.You have to remember that this is Palestine, so you will be wakened up by Muslim morning prayers from the mosque. What is so poignant and beautiful in this place is that people of all faiths, especially Christians and Muslims are living together as peaceful as they can. It warms my heart.I love Paradise Hotel. It is a good hotel owned by faithful Christians, and they love pilgrims like me.\n",

      "review_body : We were on a day trip to Jerusalem & Bethlehem from our cruise berth in Ashdod. We stopped at The Paradise Hotel for lunch. There were literally hundreds of tourists eating here at the same time so the turnover was very fast. I think that most trips to Bethlehem stop here for lunch. There were plenty of cold salads and sides to choose from, and they were topped up quickly when they ran out. There were two hot mains and this was the only hot food that there was available to choose from. Both were very nice but if you are a picky eater, had children, or you're vegetarian, you might have struggled as both were slowly cooked meat in sauce/gravy, with either rice or potatoes. Drinks were reasonably priced but the person serving was disorganised and we had finished eating by the time we were offered a drink. Thankfully there was bottled water available on each table and so we had stuck to water. The restaurant was very clean and so were the loos.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here for just one night (thank goodness). There's nothing wrong with the room we had which was in what I think was a new wing at the back of the hotel and was smart and modern. But the hotel is just full of tour groups and if you're an independent traveller reading this I couldn't think of any reason to recommend it. The hotel is located quite a way out of Bethlehem and there's nowhere nearby to eat so you're stuck with an awful buffet in the hotel dining room with (literally) several hundred fellow guests, most of whom I guess are on a package tour. Public areas of the hotel - e.g. reception and bar - are full of tour groups milling around and smoking and shouting at each other in the bar. If you get a room at the front of the hotel you are highly likely to be hit by noise from wedding party discos that the hotel seems to specialise in. Unless you really have to stay here find somewhere else.\n",

So the lobby and restaurant were filled with people from Greece, India, Romania, Turkey, Vietnam, Korea.... The room was large but the furniture and everything was a bit worn out. The TV only got 2 channels. My window looked into someone else's room, so I couldn't keep the curtain open. Overall avoid if you can.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed here for three nights at Christmas 2012.The hotel is centrally located on one of Bethlehem's main streets and if you are willing to , it is possible to walk to Manger Square and the sights in that area -- it is about 3 km each way. A taxi takes about 5 mts -- on Christmas Eve night, with many of the roads closed or jammed with traffic, we preferred to walk.There are some nice shops and grocery stores in the areas also a few pleasant restaurants.The hotel is not the lap of luxury -- that said, the rooms are very clean and comfortable with well equipped , clean bathrooms. Buffet meals were fresh and wholesome with good variety. On Christmas Eve we had a full Christmas buffet and the several choirs staying at the hotel gave us an impromptu performance of Christmas music with dinner, right there in the dining room. That was a treat I shall always remember. The Christmas atmosphere was hard to beat and genuine.The staff were always helpful and efficient , with taxis, tour information, wheelchair assistance etc.I have nothing but praise for this hotel and would definitely stay here again.\n",

They have a large dining room and a fairly good spread. It takes about 20 minutes to Jerusalem though which is where most of the attractions are.The lobby was good and had good wifi connection. My mum loved the massage chair in the lobby after all the walking in Jerusalem. :)The staff at the reception were nice and friendly. The folks at the bar, the dining room and the porters were not helpful at all. They would say \"No English\" to any question without making any efforts to listen or help. We had to wait for some time to get drinks at the bar because the staff were inside the kitchen or something.I would recommend this hotel as a nice and quiet place to stay.\n",

I was shown in my room which had a large bathroom. The first thing I did was to take a refreshing bath. I changed and visited the restaurant where I had piping hot freshly prepared food that pacified a hungry me. When I returned to my room and turned on the air conditioning, it was a perfect bed that cozily carried me to sleep peacefully. I slept and slept for hours together and got rejuvenated.

      "review_body : We stayed in late May/early June 2010 as part of a tour of ISRAEL and Palestine.The hotel rooms were average and the buffet food was okay but average. Hotel was fairly full with a number of bus companies staying at the hotel and desk service was acceptable.HOWEVER, after travelling most of the day to get to the hotel (with many of the tour group having been awake since 4am that morning in order to catch an early plane flight), we all expected a good night's rest. Unfortunately, there was a large wedding group booked in the ground level function room, and their music was extremely loud. We clearly heard the thump, thump, thump of the bass from the 5th floor room. We complained to hotel staff, and asked at the front desk for the music to be turned down, and several others from our bus trip also complained as they had rooms on lower floors. We then phoned the desk again when nothing had been done about the loud music. The manager, who by this time had become involved, did absolutely nothing and the noise continued at the same horrendous volume until close to midnight . In addition, the wedding party were very noisy on departure, meaning that several very tired, paying hotel guests did not get any sleep till around 1 am.We were very annoyed and disappointed, and would never stay at this hotel again. We will, in fact, warn all our friends to STAY AWAY from the Paradise Hotel at Bethlehem.We expected to have a lovely time in such a special place as Bethlehem.NOT IMPRESSED at all !!!\n",

      "review_body : This hotel is more like a hotel from hell, not \"Paradise\". We stayed there when visiting Bethlehem with a tour starting from Egypt. The hotel is a dirty hole. The corridors are full of rubbish, dust is everywhere. The rooms are dirty, shabby, more than basic, with disgusting black and yellow spots on the carpet, terrible green bathroom and windows looking as if they had never been washed. The location is far from the center. Our guide told us Yassir Arafat had used to stay at this hotel. Now it is clear why his death was early. It is strange that the hotel is visited by many Spanish and Italian tourists, paying US$ 85 per night (a rip off) since the quality is not adequate for Europeans. The restaurant was OK nonetheless but it can't not improve the entire impression from the hotel. Never again!!!\n",

      "review_body : First of all, my apology to the hotel staff, they did their best but unfortunately the overall experience was bad, very bad. I don't know if this poor outcome was because of this time in the season with lack of tourists, but my recommendation to the hotel owners to close the gate if they offer this kind of service to their visitors, even if they are the only guests!!After I went through most of the reviews here and got the impression of good hotel, I booked for 2 connected rooms for 2 nights stay with my family (2 adults and 4 children). We arrived at noon. My first impression was: \"wait.. where is everybody? I don't see any guests here\". Then we got out rooms at the 5th floor, but the next room was under renovations, and I felt that may cause some noise, so I asked the reception girl to let us move to different floor. She was nice and we moved to 2nd floor.The rooms size was ok, but that where it ends. The beds was in bad condition, no children channels in the tv, the hot water was on demand (yes! only after we called the reception we were able to get a hot bath), the babies beds was not suitable for kids sleep!! Already at midnight we decided to cancel the 2nd night and get back home early in the morning.Then the morning has arrived. We went to restaurant floor to get some breakfast at ~8:30AM, but all of the sudden the lights was off and some staff women asks us if \"you want to eat breakfast?\" !!! I asked her: \"are there any guests in the hotel anyway?\" She replied: \"only you\"!! Then some guy made for us some eggs and few things!! of-course we couldn't eat anything because we already lost our appetite. Again, I don't blame the hotel staff but the owners who let these level of service happen to people who paid for it!!Immediately after this horrible experience, we collected our things, went down to the reception, cancel the 2nd night, paid whatever we had to pay for, and got out of there. Oh, home sweet home!!\n",

If ur looking for a comfortable stay in a comfortable location this is the place to be... very comfortable rooms with the best quality bed, 24/7 hot water in toilets , good food which they change if ur in a group to ur taste buds. .... and very loving people.... ready to help and be at ur assistance always... the hotel also is centrally located with lot of eat outs near by like Shawarmas, sweets shops and other yummy foods....The management team of the Hotel under the leadership of Fadi is so excellent that they try to improvise every year... the rooms have good view and most of all u feel ur at ur own home...Do book in advance or u may not find rooms as they are usually full...

      "review_body : Stayed 5 nights as a part of a group. It looked as if 80-90% of guests were members of groups. Room (on 8th floor) was comfortable and clean with towels changed every day. Free wi-fi worked well. The breakfast/dining room is in the basement and lacks any charm or intimacy. Food is all buffet style with reasonable choice. Just a shame that \"fruit\" juice at breakfast is a sugary industrial product, given the amount of fresh fruit that grows in Israel & Palestine. On the ground floor there is a spacious bar area, again with little charm and a very limited range of alcoholic drinks.As remarked by another reviewer, the two lifts are very efficient.Given the huge challenges of running a business in Palestine, this is a good place stay, although some way from the main attractions in Bethelem.\n",

      "review_body : Nice hotel a bit far away from the Nativity square. The staff is nice and helpful during check-in, arranging taxis etc. The biggest drawback is the room and the fact that the hotel carries a four star rating, but maybe the star scale is different in Bethlehem than in other countries. E.g. during the day there was no hot water in the shower. Our room was so-so cleaned during our stay where e.g. used service wasn't replaced.However, it was very nice with a balcony and the view was great.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here beginning May for 03 nts on our Holy Land tour, a very comfortable hotel, was lucky to find a room with a balcony on the 8th floor which overlooked the Manger Hill , enjoyed the sunrise & nite views which were awesome, dawn had a beautiful salmon shaded horizon and nights with illuminated towers & minarets.... The beds very comfortable with short small size satin sheets, a big cupboard occupied so much of space hence no space for any chairs in the room.,but the big sliding glass door to the balcony gave a spacious feeling .. unfortunately this beautiful balcony was dusty & had units of A/C of other rooms.The shower cubicle small but, at least we could turn around & there was place for keeping toiletteries. had good quality of supplies & even a hair dryer.. on the whole enjoyed quality sleep and very clean with fresh towels everyday.Regarding meals, the breakfast okay but dinner terrible, dinning area resembled a hostel dinning hall, no decor no windows very claustrophobic as it was in the basement...hopefully it was a make shift arrangement as the hotel seems like it had had no time for the finishing touches.Reception great has a beautiful mosaic picture of the sheperds.Best thing we did from this hotel is one evening, some of us after the days tour, refreshed & took a cab to the Manger square at sixish & the same cab collected us at 8 pm for only 10 us dollars , not per person!!! We thouroughly enjoyed the Manger square atmosphere, shopped to our heart's content, the prices were half the marked as there was no tour guide along, thats what the shop owners told us, please contact Saliba Bandak 38 Milk grotto street, has nice icons & good stuff & good prices but without the guide, thats how we got to know of the commissions.And moreso such a beautiful feeling in the square, calm & peaceful,when illuminated one see''s the crosses of all shapes--,Greek orthodox, R catholic & the Armenian.We also met some local people & tasted local food, we tried backlava from a street vendor. Dont miss this outting, even though the guides advice you against this & give you all sorts of excuses of shops being shut, unsafe etc. please experience the good vibes & shop at ease . Last thing bought stamps from the reception & posted some picture postcards( handed to the reception) by affixing 2 US dollars worth of stamps per card which never reached the destinations.\n",

Our room did not cool down like we wanted. We discovered that during the day room air conditioners are turned off at the front desk. Our room never cooled down enough for comfortable sleeping. Had our air conditioner worked properly my rating would be higher. We asked that the system be fixed, but nothing changed.The breakfast and supper and buffets were fresh and good. We definitely enjoyed the food. The outdoor deck was enjoyable for socializing.\n",

      "review_body : The hotel was basic and spartan, but the front desk was very friendly and helpful with information. The room and bathroom met all the basic needs. One of the neighbours has a dog that won't shut up though! The location allowed us to walk around to local shops and bakeries. It is also only 15 minutes walk to the Separation wall graffiti and Banksy's Walled Off Hotel.\n",

No blow dryer or ironing board in the room, but they quickly bring them to you if you ask. I liked how clean our room and the public spaces were. There is a patio that you can sit out on in good weather and enjoy a beverage. Breakfast and dinner were served in the dining room and offered a variety of Mediterranean salads and food. It was quite good. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel. \n",

      "review_body : Need a cup of hot tea, quick directions, assistance with WIFI, or just a quiet, secure and comfortable place to sleep, then book at the Angel Hotel in Beir Jala, a stone's throw from Bethlehem. I had an extended stay there and consistently friendly service with a smile was always available. Breakfast each morning was dependable and good and set me up for a day of travel. Johnny and Sandra were especially helpful and based on their service along I would rate this hotel as a 10 and recommend all my friends to stay there. Maybe a hidden benefit the Angel is located near Bethlehem but far enough away to avoid some of the craziness of the tourist \"hot\" spots. No hesitation - this is a great place to stay! One last thing, after breakfast, walk out on to the patio/roof for a spectacular view of Beit Jala and Bethlehem, from there you can see St. Nicolas' golden dome and steeple as well as the Latin Patriarch Church and school. You can also see the Latin Patriarch's seminary with its 400 year old olive trees.\n",

      "review_body : The Angel Hotel is a small property in Beit Jala, a nearby city adjacent to old Bethlehem. We had expected a relatively small, walkable community south of Jerusalem in Judea, but the complex of cities was surprisingly large and spread out. The property was modern with smallish rooms and tiny bathrooms, but it was well appointed and immaculately clean and efficient. The dining room serves extensive breakfast and dinners, buffet-style. The choices appetizers and salads was remarkable, and very well done, Mediterranean fare heavy with salads, vegetables and dips. There are always meat and fish options, which is ideal for our visit during Great Lent.Everyone, from the welcome, check-in, front desk services, concierge services and dining room were very motivated to please in very good English.\n",

Bathroom is also very small and the WC is placed right in front of the glass opening partition to the shower area; most uncomfortable. Liquid soap container is inconveniently located and one cannot get it unless you are right under the shower. Toilet kit consisted of just two small cakes of soap only. Bath towels kept on the dressing table and no provision for hanging wet towels. Shower area level is higher and water flows out to the wash basin area.

      "review_body : I travelled to Bethlehem recently as part of a group of 23 family and friends. For many of us it was our first visit to the Holy Land and the Angel Hotel helped to make it truly memorable.The rooms were basic yet well equipped and they were all very clean. Some of our group had baths, some only had a shower but everything worked well. Each room had a fridge, air conditioning and hairdryers were available to borrow from reception. Free wifi was available throughout the hotel though it worked better in the bar and lobby. There was some noise through the night due to the tiled floors throughout the corridors and rooms of the hotel.All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful and we were always greeted with smiles. The bar staff were particularly helpful and remembered our orders after the first night. The public areas were all very pleasant and welcome after spending a day exploring the many sites nearby.The food in the hotel was very good. The dining room is set up for large groups with long tables but the food was always fresh and plentiful even when the dining room was busy. They were accommodating when we needed to eat outside of the usual hours on a couple of occasions during our stay.The hotel provided a perfect base for us and we would not hesitate to return. Thank you Angel Hotel!\n",

      "review_body : Angel Hotel, far as I can tell, is mostly frequented by tour groups. Some rooms have three beds, some two, some one. Imagine our surprise when me and my mother stepped into a room with three twin beds that was reminiscent of a college dorm room. The room was generally clean and basic with limited furnishings and decorations. There was no shampoo/conditioner or lotion provided; three tiny pats of soap and a dispenser (shampoo? bath gel?) in the shower was all I found. Towels were very thin and thread bare. The room could be noisy at night - a dog barking next door, traffic on the street. The restaurant upstairs is setup for tours with long tables for 16 people. There are a few tables for 2 or 4 along the wall. Soft drinks and wine are available to purchase with the meal. Breakfast and dinner are served as buffet style with lots of salads and a few hot dishes. All that said, Angel Hotel wants to grow, and could use your support! Very nice people.\n",

      "review_body : This hotel is okay . It is not centrally located but we were on a tour and busy all day so it was fine. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food was okay with the usual assortment of mid eastern salads etc. Room was clean but a little small for 2. Front desk lent me an adapter and hair dryer so that was nice. \n",

      "review_body : We had traveled as a big group for a Holy Land trip to Egypt and Israel with the help of Silverhearts Travel. We were scheduled to spend the 7th day and the 8th day of the safari in Bethlehem. We arrived in Bethlehem excited on the eve of 19th Sept. 2014 after a whole day tour in Galilee and were received well, the potters even offered to carry our bags to our rooms. We were excited when we found out that our room was very spacious, clean and nice. It was a corner room. The only issue was that it was a bit noisy. We could hear the vehicles zooming up the hill. We called and request for a change of room. The reservation guy was very kind enough and allowed us to change our room. We got another quieter, clean room with good working AC and a fridge to cool some milk we had bought in a supermarket in Bethlehem. The dinner was great that night. They also offered us huge apple fruit. The apples were so nice, we requested for some more so that we could carry into the room which they offered gladly. The waiter's that night were friendly we even chatted with them. After dinner we decided to relax at their roof top lounge/restaurant for a moment but it was a bit windy and cold. We requested for a warm glass of water. We were directed to the bar downstairs where we were kindly offered warm water in a glass.The staff were friendly and welcoming but it was only for that night. The following morning the breakfast was not all that. We later left for our day tour. We came in the evening for dinner tired after our day tour in Bethlehem. We found new waiters that night on 20th Sept. The waiters were not friendly. I remember we arrived a bit late after refreshing in our room only to find a few things remaining for dinner While enjoying our dinner, the waiter started preparing the tables for the following day. One of the waiters seems to have been very tired and angered by something. He kept on placing the cutlery and plates on the tables with a bang to teh extent that he kept on interrupting our conversation. He even broke some glasses in our site. Thanks to God! he was a bit far from us. The starter soup was wanting. Only 1cold cup remained. As a gentleman i offered to give it to my wife since she comes first as far my priorities are concerned. We requested the chef of the day to warm the cold soup for my wife and also to make another hot one for me. We were shocked to find out that the chef added 1 cup of water and corn starch to the cold one to make it 2, proceeded to warm it with microwave...i wish you were there to taste. It tasted horrible. We kept it aside and humbly went for the main course which was also one of the the worst during our whole safari. It was badly done, no varieties but same old, no creativity invested in the preparation of the dinner. I think i can prepare better meals given a chance..Woke up the following morning to same old breakfast. Be warned if you are the kind that mind about eating healthy food and taking freshly home made juice. Their juice which is offered through the dispenser is not fresh juice. Its the concentrated version mixed with water, no wonder its free. I thought fruits are exported by their neighbor. At least they should indicate that on the dispenser...that this is not home made juice. Well i left rather happy and disappointed about their food.Their rooms are nice with automated window curtains.\n",

      "review_body : Our St. Ann's group from LaVernia, TX, USA really loved our 6 night stay in Bethlehem region. The meals were great and always a source for much discussion on the various salads served and other region foods and arabic coffee. Staff was attentive to our needs. My roommate and I had to more to another room when we found ourselves on first night with a door that wouldn't lock. We always got our wake up calls and they responded quickly on our needs. You have to call when you return to your room after touring to get the A/C turned back on and they are quick to do it. The hotel is in an ideal spot. Oh, you can purchase inexpensive t-shirts there and I liked their selection of postcards- ie. with mosaics.\n",

It is a good 15 minute walk to the main attractions such as Manger Square and The Church of the Nativity but it is easy to pick up a taxi. The hotel is clean and comfortable and the rooms are a good size. We only had breakfast one morning - the was not a vast choice of food but it was all fresh and nicely presented. Wed had no problem with noise from other rooms or lack of wifi. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful.\n",

      "review_body : The Angel Hotel is located in the neighborhood, so you get a nice feel for local conditions. Since staying here is likely a step above what the locals have, it's hard to complain.Having said that, the walls are very thin and if you speak in a normal voice, open and close drawer, flush the toilet, you will be heard in adjoining rooms. The rooms were reasonably clean and well kept. The bed was comfortable. Our room had a very cramped bathroom where you had to close the door to use the sink. Others, I understand, did not have this situation.Breakfast and dinner buffets were varied and delicious. Be prepared to be awakened daily by the Muslim call to prayer early in the morning.I'm not sure how this hotel would measure up to others in the area, but it is a viable option when travelling in the area.\n",

      "review_body : Great family hotel in the Christian area of Bethlehem; stayed 6-days...great \"jumping off point\" for those doing Jerusalem and the Dead Sea area. Rooms, bathroom, and common areas are well kept and clean. No frills...but that is ok as you are likely on a pilgrimage tour and you come back for a quick meal, a bit of socializing and then to bed ready for the next day. A small bar down stairs; dinning room on top floor; service & desk responsive to all needs; breakfast/dinners were good...no complaints. There are a few \"convenience\" store (family run) around the corner along the main street...along with a few small restaurants and coffee shops nearby if you want to break away from the tour group. A 15-minute walk along the same road takes you into the hustle-bustle of the city with a few small markets, clothing stores, bakery, coffee shop (etc). Strongly recommend you buy your snacks & water from the small convenience stores. Botttom-line - a good choice for independent travelers and tour groups.\n",

In addition to our pilgrimage to Israel, we planned to exchange our wedding vows on the first night of our trip. When we arrived at the Angel Hotel, we spoke with Wilma who was delighted to help us in any way possible. Even though we had not made any previous arrangements with the hotel, they were all extremely gracious and accommodating to our every need. That evening, we had a small candlelight service with communion in their upper conference room overlooking the city lights of Bethlehem. Everything was so beautiful and special - what a perfect memory! Thank you so much Wilma and may God bless you, your staff, and the Angel Hotel for all your hospitality.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed for 2 nights in this hotel in Bethlehem as part of a tour group. The managers were very nice and helpful. There was some street noise, but not overwhelming. The dining area for breakfast and dinner is on the top floor and very nice and the food was good quality. The only drawbacks were the towels and the soap - not only were the towels small but so rough they could peel off the first layer of your skin. And the soap bar was very tiny - bring your own soap and washcloth if you plan to stay here\n",

      "review_body : I spent two nights at the Angel hotel while in Israel in December . The electricity went off several times in the evenings while I was trying to shower or doing something in the room. It left the room and bathroom totally dark. Very scary. Alarms went off in the hallways in the early morning hours causing everyone to get up and wonder into the hallways to see if there was a fire. Luckily there wasn't but we were never given an explanation as to why they continued to alarm. The alarms continued to ring for over 15 minutes, very irritating. There were no washcloths and the towels were rough, not soft at all. When I asked for a washcloth I was told by staff to use a towel. The room was small and the bedding was nothing to brag about. I would not stay again.\n",

The place is not new but is very very clean, it is run by a family and the food is great. Serves breakfast and evening meal. The only thing I could find wrong was the towels were not soft.

The staff are nice and helpful. The rooms were really clean and well equipped, with free WiFi throughout the Hotel. It has a great roof terrace and nice courtyard sitting area linked to the bar. We ate out in the evenings so I cannot comment on the quality of the dinner served. Breakfast is served in the top floor restaurant and consists mainly of buffet style hot and cold food. All good and fresh, but with room for improvement (decent coffee, jams and juices would make all the difference for me).\n",

We arrived in the evening - a group of 45 people and in less than 10 minutes everyone was checked in and in less than half an hour we were having dinner which was exellent by the way. In the morning we had tasty breakfast and enjoyed the view from the open terrace of the restaurant. And bed was oh so comfortable! I gave the hotel a 4 rating because of only one reason.

      "review_body : What a haven this hotel is. It's a Christian family run hotel in a great spot for ease of visiting key sites in the Holy Land. The hotel offers clean, comfortable accommodation that is just what you need after sight seeing/fact finding in this complex part of the world. The buffet breakfast and dinner offers something for everyone with a wide array of salads and fresh fruit and vegetables. There is a bar selling locally produced beer and wine as well as everything else you could ask for. It's greatest jewel is the incredible friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, you would rarely come across a more amazingly helpful staff team. I would highly recommend a stay there, for those people put off by the fact that Bethlehem is under Palestinian control and therefore behind the wall do not let this stop you. In fact it's a very good reason to go and see for yourself what the situation actually is like.\n",

      "review_body : When on a pilgrimage, you eschew the luxuries of a 5 star hotel. What you want is a clean, comfortable place to stay, close to the various Holy Sites in the area. Angel is a fine place for this. The hotel is located in a convenient location in the city, has clean comfortable rooms with a nice bath. A small bar is located on the ground floor, while the dinning room is located on the 4th. Meal service at breakfast and dinner is buffet style, with a wide variety of salads and a choice of several hot dishes, including meat, fish and chicken served with vegetables, rice and potatoes. I cannot comment on lunch as we ate that meal on the road. One must also put up with the vagaries of the free internet opperating intermittantly in the rooms. A computer is available in the lobby for your use. Located on a main road, it is about 250' to a small convenience store that gives excellent prices on snack food and soda and is well worth the trip rather than paying the hotel prices. I also went further afield to purchase an electrical adapter and felt entirely comfortable doing so during the day. Again it is a facillity providing for basic necessities without any frills. Be advised this hotel is used heavily by a Christian tour company during their busy periods from January through May and room availability may be limited.\n",

I can be calm over that this hotel lives up to my expectations. Clean and good service, the staff is so helpful. 100 % ther for you. The food is very good.Everything they serv is homemade which I really like. One bad thing is that ther is not sp much to do around the hotel. But as I heard things are improving. I would warmly recommend this hotel to anybody coming to Bethlehem, See ya soon again Jens Mikelsen\n",

      "review_body : we were there for a visit in bethlehem and the area. I was there with 5 other friends. we were 6 people and decided to take two rooms. 3 persons in each.they gave us the most far rooms in the resort. the rooms were old, and dirty, the sheets were torn and the beds where not comfortable. this was the most expensive amount of money we ever paid for a room in Bethlehem.I have to say we were there 3 years ago. same gang. and it was way better. I don't know what happened.anyway, we left the resort one day before the scheduled time because we were not satisfied.Breakfast was too poor and we didn't have enough.There were a Nigerian group in the resort at the same time with us and they were very noisy. they sang through the night and we couldn't sleep.a good thing to say about the place is the people in the reception. they were very helpful and informative.and the turkish cave, with hot sauna and shower. is a great experience.\n",

      "review_body : As previously stated, this resort is a bit run down, not surprising due to it's location in the West Bank. However, the rooms are clean, the people are lovely and kind, it's a relaxing place, and of course good value.There are some nice walks around the complex, hilly scrubland but interesting and it is safe as could be, have no fear. The pool has many local day visitors with their kids but it is not a problem and it gives you a chance to meet the families. Food is average but fine. All in all a good value stay.\n",

      "review_body : PROS: The Turkish bath area is very unique and special. Breakfast is good with variety of Middle Eastern food choices. And the room is beautifully rustic. Staff are helpful in helping us with making phone calls to our taxi driver. CONS: The place is on the outskirt of town so make sure you communicate that clearly with your taxi driver. At night, the restaurant was so loud until past midnight. Music, people laughing and yelling made it impossible to sleep. The place is locked behind a gate. We did venture out walking on the nearby hill to experience life in the West Bank but could not go far. It did not feel very safe. The Turkish bath area was restricted for only certain time and segregated women from men by time. I believe this segregation is practiced widely in the Arab world. I ended up not being able to use it.Stayed on Christmas Eve 2011.\n",

      "review_body : This was the find of the century when it comes to hidden gems..This rather bizzare hotel is situated on the outskirts of Bethlehem in the Palestinian Territories. I stayed there one night having found it on booking.com for around £45 ($70US). Its difficult to find and is down a dirt track on the edge of Bethlehem and a good 10 minute car journey from Manger Square at the centre of Bethlehem (you couldn't walk it). Also there is absolutely nothing else around here other than the hotel itself.But thats the only downside. I turned up to a set of electronic security gates. I was greeted by the security guard whilst another member of staff took my luggage and then parked my car. Real 5 star stuff this!Walked into reception and was given a free drink whilst they sorted my room key. I was escorted to my room along with a waiter who followed me with a pot of coffee for the room.The room itself was first class. Great air con. International satellite TV, a stunnig view of Bethlehem from the balcony, Huge bed. All for $70! Now this place does describe itself as a resort. It had a massive swimming pool with water slides, (no water in the pool though but im guessing its because it was winter) Saunas, turkish baths, childrens playgrounds etc.. But here is the bad news.Me and my two friends were the ONLY people staying there!And my $70 probably didnt even cover the cost of the electric lights they had on that evening.I think the main problem the resort has is first of all no locals are likely to stay there (although there was a great wedding party on in the bar that evening for a local family).Secondly most foreign tourists are bussed in and out of Bethlehem and do not spend the night there which is a great shame.So if you really want to see Bethlehem stay the night in the town and make sure you stay at the Murad. It needs your support and is really trying to make a go of things in a difficult area.(check out the Peace Wall 100 yards from the Hotel).Having said this I am guessing that its alot more buzzy in the height of the Summer. And I for one hope to find out because I am for sure going back for another stay at the quite incredibly cheap 5 star Murad.\n",

      "review_body : The resort is a great place to spend one’s valuable time at. I visited the Murad Tourist Resort along with my family members last year. It was great. The experience is still fresh in our memories. The Hammam Turkish bath, the sauna, and the massage were very soothing. It relaxed my nerves. It is a great get away from the hectic city life back at home. The staffs out here are nice and offer a wonderful service. The food is excellent. The prices are highly reasonable and even if it had been pricey, the experience would be worth the money. I would love to visit this resort again with my family. The experience is fabulous!\n",

The staff here were superb and made us feel very relaxed and were very appreciative of actually having some tourists in their lovely hotel. Factilities were excellent, a little out of the way but with the West Bank being so inexpensive you dont mind having to get a cab to Manger Square where most of the acitivity is.

      "review_body : The economic squeeze on Palestine continues to tighten (a law is even being promulgated which would ban visitors to Israel from staying a night in Palestine), so it's not fair to grade the Grand as though it were in Jerusalem or Tiberias; so I'll keep my criticisms to those things which could be rectified by management rather than cash. Firstly, the service is first-class: very friendly indeed, and caring of its customers. Main public facilities are excellent -- especially the large lobby area, the bar, the conference room, and third-floor restaurant. As everywhere in this region there is so much fresh fruit and veg that breakfast is a delight (although the hot offering -- sour beans and sausages -- won't be to everyone's liking). Oddly, the sixty-plus guests in the dining room served themselves coffee from a single jug on a warming plate -- it didn't last three minutes.Secondly, the location is ideal, right in the middle of the bustling narrow streets, and easy walking distance to the main tourist sights. The locals are immensely friendly. Thirdly, if you're a smoker (as I am) you'll be pleased to be able to get a smoking room and even to smoke in the lounge -- that won't sound like good news to non-smokers, but somehow the residual smell of tobacco doesn't linger (and most visitors go outside to smoke anyway).Given the pleasantness described above, my room was disappointing. On the plus-side It was a good size, with a very comfortable double bed; and there were electricity sockets aplenty. However, I had to physically move the TV to create a work-space; no bath plug, so no bath; an entrance door that wouldn't stay shut unless locked; coffee not replenished; the hot water took an unusually long time to come through. These are management lapses, not the consequence of diminished cashflow.However, all-in-all the establishment and its location were so charming that I'll be staying there again.\n",

It's very well appointed, the staff were fun and fantastic (we even did a Palestinian cooking class there !) , and it's walking distance to Manger Square / Church of the Nativity.We felt very safe at this hotel and in Bethlehem, Palestine. No trip to the Holy Land is complete with a stop at Bethlehem, but don't rush it and just make it a day trip, stay at the Grand Hotel Bethlehem, relax and immerse into the area... and you won't be sorry.\n",

      "review_body : This is one of the worst experiences of my life. Don't stay here under any circumstances. The rooms are filthy, it stinks of raw sewage coming from the bathroom into the bedroom, the mattress feel like its 20 years old, the carpets and walls are badly stained, the staff are cocky and unhelpful and the area is seedy. The noise coming in from the street is unbearable. Avoid avoid avoid! \n",

      "review_body : Bethlehem can be a scary place these days, but the desire to see the birthplace of Jesus is a strong motivator for many. We recently spent 4 days at The Grand Hotel in Bethlehem. Our trip from the Ben Gurion Airport required a van rather than a taxi for security reasons and since we were arriving late at night it was a bit of a jolt to find a dark deserted town with nobody on the street, something that is the status quo these days. The next day we began to see activity and enjoyed our tour of the area. The hotel was in a safe area and quite comfortable. Although some of our group, felt the sting of tear gas in their eyes, that was the most drama we experienced for which we were grateful. Food was good and plentiful.\n",

      "review_body : The one downfall of this hotel is that you cannot book it online through Orbitz, travelocity, etc. But it is about a 5 to 7 minute walk to the Nativity Church. Once you walk in to the hotel you are greeted by the reception desk on the left side. There is a mexican restaurant called Mariachi on the right side of the lobby and it has excellent food. The atmosphere in the lobby and restaurant is friendly and relaxing, especially at night. Our room had a nice side view of the cityscape of Bethlehem. The hotel staff are very welcoming and hospitable. The room has a flat screen TV although there are about 8-11 channels to choose from and most are not in English. This hotel has wi-fi, just make sure you get the voucher code from the reception desk. There are plenty of outlets in the room and the beds Were great.I cannot rate the breakfast since I've been sleeping past breakfast times.\n",

I remember one time their staff waited till 1130 pm for our group to arrive and have dinner since we got late at the border.The have free internet facility at the lobby even though only one PC was dedicated for it. Food was good with many varieties. The hotel is a little away from the market. But there is a small super market in walk able distance. I understand recently they had some renovations so that the guests can be more happy. Wishing them good luck in continuing the good service.\n",

      "review_body : We (my wife daughter and myself) visited Egypt, Israel and Jordan as part a 30 member group from Chennai India. We stayed in Nativity Hotel from 3rd to 6th nights of our tour for 4 nights. First of all the name is Nativity Hotel and not Nativity Bells hotel( I don’t know if there is a Nativity Bells hotel somewhere else in Bethlehem)Location wise the Hotel is situated on a busy road. The décor was impressive, the rooms and bathrooms were very big and spacious, free wifi was available in the lobby, the cleanliness of the hotel and rooms was amazing and to top it all there was a really fantastic departmental store within a stones throw away where you can get everything from bottled water, fresh breads,fresh cakes, sweets, fresh juices , cool drinks, ice creams etc etc at local prices not tourist prices. This store was a real Godsend for tourists like us who are forced to shell out huge amounts for savouring the local flavours. Next to this store is a textile store which also has a number of t shirts, and ready made garments at throw away prices. The only negative about this hotel was that the food menu for breakfast and dinner remained practically unchanged throughout the duration of our stay there resulting in a monotonous diet for us. We had some time leftover in the evening and decided to visit the shops near the Church of Nativity for some local food and shopping. A taxi ride costs roughly 20 shekels from the hotel. The prices of souvenirs and gift items in Bethlehem are almost half the rates compared with the shops in Jerusalem. I strongly advise you to buy all gift items and souvenirs at Bethlehem itself if you have a chance to do so. And I can tell you Bethlehem is a very safe place(at least at the time of my visit) to go around the town by night to do some last minute shopping. The people here are extremely friendly and respect tourists especially when you are accompanied by family. I want to inform you that most of the buses and hotels in Israel are wi fi enabled so if you have a good smartphone and the persons you want to contact are also having a smartphone, you can communicate via viber or other apps. No need to spend for an international calling card. To sum up Nativity Hotel is a very good choice to stay in Bethlehem and I am sure that you will thoroughly enjoy yourself if you choose to do so.\n",

Unfortunately this guests stay was marred by building work which resulted in Jose, dust and nowhere to sit. Nice little place and sure the new roof restaurant will be great when finished but wait until then!\n",

We had a great room overlooking the Shepherd's Field off our balcony and windows and out our right window we could see the spires of the Church of the Nativity. Room was excellent, staff was always helpful, breakfast was kept well stocked and fresh all the time. Just up the hill from the hotel is a small store, ATM, and a cut through that let's you walk right onto Star Street and a five minute walk to Nativity Square. The owners of the hotel (a Christian family) are almost always onsite and the father of the family will always take time to talk to you about life in Palestine as he grew up and then raised his family there as well\n",

      "review_body : I spent 4 nights at the Nativity Bells Hotel in September. I can recommend this hotel for its nice rooms and friendly service. There is construction noise during the day since the hotel is not finished. Floors 5-7 are being completed, so I recommend staying on the first or second floor if you're there during the day. Personally I like to nap in the afternoon, and this would not be possible on floors 3 or 4. There is some dust in the elevator and common areas due to the ongoing construction. The Bethlehem sights are about 10' away, which makes the hotel a convenient option. Since the hotel is not far from the shared taxi departure point it's a good base for visiting the West Bank. I went to Hebron, Ramallah, Jericho, and Herodium this way. Since the hotel caters to groups, try to get an end room or you are liable to be in the middle of lots of boring conversations going on right outside your door. Finally I will mention that the hotel is Christian owned and that Bethlehem has a significant Christian minority. However, I was treated well in Bethlehem and elsewhere in the West Bank by the entire population. Highly recommended!\n",

The food is reasonable but some of the leftovers from the night are served the next morning. The staff are not very friendly, there is no Room service and no Coffee maker in the room. Some of the rooms are small boxes. Using the lifts is an ordeal as there are only two with only one working properly and limited capacityThere are different Pilgrim groups given different timings for Breakfast.

      "review_body : This is a difficult one. I do not like to be over critical of places where there are difficulties, as is the case in Bethlehem, but this hotel is not somewhere I would want to return to. We were on a pilgrimage and the travel company like to bring in trade to help the economy here, an aim that I have to agree with, but I have the impression that the staff and management here could do a lot more to make a stay more enjoyable. The rooms are small, decoration very old and generally run down. The water was cut off twice in the week we were there and the lifts kept breaking down. Every time something like this went wrong there were profuse apologies from the manager who stressed all the problems they experience, and then something else would go wrong. There must be better hotels in Bethlehem.\n",

Our room was basic with cheap plastic bathroom accessories, rough towels and we had to ask for a bath mat. The beds were clean but the room itself could do with a good cleaning and scrubbing.What I found most annoying was the very basic food that was laid on for breakfast and dinner. No imagination at all. We were watched like hawks in case we ate too much. At dinner the food was put on your plate by a so-called chef who gave you on piece of meat and you dare not come back for seconds. The flies were landing on the food and it's no wonder I got a dose of the trots while staying there. Definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel; but make up your own mind.\n",

      "review_body : Myself and my partner stayed here for several nights in November 2015. The location is good as it is close to Manger Square and other sites of historical interest. However, we found the hotel itself to be below the expected standard. Our room was small and although it had a large window looking down on the town, the glass was almost opaque through not having been cleaned for a very long time. Furthermore, the window didn't open. We took breakfast and dinner at the hotel and found the food to be of lower quality than we are used to. In general the hotel seemed a little down at heel. The staff were pleasant but we would seek out a better class hotel, albeit at a greater cost, were we to return to Bethlehem.\n",

Had to change rooms and the staff were very accommodating. We went in December and it was so atmospheric with all the decorations and fireworks. Definitely the best time to go as no queues and out of season but really warm and wore t-shirt most of the time. It is quiet and clean.\n",

      "review_body : We had the opportunity of staying in this hotel from the 13 to the 19th of August when touring the Holy Land and found it to be superlative. The rooms are neat and tidy and through the windows wonderful scenery of Bethlehem can be seen. This wonderful hotel is located in the Bethlehem City, near to the Nativity Church where Jesus has born.It offers the opportunity to reach treasures of the past within walking distance. The Church of Nativity, the Souks and Souvenir Shops, David's Well, Olive Wood Carvings, the beauty of the land, and its people - these are just some of things which make Bethlehem a unique and an unforgettable little town which is astonishingly close reach from this hotel.The Roof Top Restaurant is an experience recommended to every Bethlehem visitor for its breath-taking view of the Church of Nativity Herodion Fortress Souk and David's Well, The Shepherds Field- Jerusalem the Mouab Mountain and the beauty of the land which is wonderful to behold from the vantage point of this roof top.Bethlehem Star Hotel provides very spacious deluxe rooms in a nine floor building. All rooms are well furnished and provided with modern technologies. Lobby bar, meeting room with freshen up area, dining room and a restaurant.Rooms feature LCD Satellite TV, A.C, Free WI-FI Internet Access,Telephone-Direct Dial Phone with wake up calls, Mini Bar includes Hot and Cold WaterHairdryer, Safe Deposit Box, Fire Alarm, Free WI-Fi Access and Iron andBaby Cot on request.

The bedrooms were o,k. but there was neither a safe or a kettle available. The shower was poor but there was a good supply of towels and toiletries . Breakfast was limited - not a great selection but there was plenty of food available. Dinner was better with a choice of four hot dishes and several salads. The hotel is close to a street where there are several shops and it is a ten minute walk to the Church of the Nativity.\n",

Superb views over Bethlehem, clean and comfortable rooms, excellent service, good food.The hotel is owned by Christians but the staff are all Muslim men - I did remark about the absence of women but had a vague reply to the effect of 'we used to have them but not now'?! It is an easy walk to the main attractions.I went with a tour operator that has used this hotel for years, and was told that they have never had a theft from a room, so maybe the absence of safes is not that much of a problem. Enjoyed my 8 nights here and thoroughly recommend this hotel.\n",

The service is very good and the food is excellent. The rooms are comfortable and none of my group complained about anything.It's good to be in walking distance of the Church of Nativity, and the view from the 8th floor dining room is amazing.My group of 12 came for a pilgrimage, but most had been with me before, so I'll say they were friends.\n",

Water pressure is much better than I expected. The beds are serviceable, but by no means cozy. The staff are very friendly and very happy to try to accommodate your needs. The hotel is in a neighborhood, so you get a slice of everyday life in Bethlehem. The restaurant on the top floor serves a simply wonderful breakfast buffet.

      "review_body : Hello i stayed here as part of a group of 26. On a pilgrimage to the holy land. The rooms we had were all on the upper floors (floor 7) and all had great view from the windows. Rooms were brand new and very clean. Bedding was excellent and room facilities included tv. Air con that if it goes off just call reception and for some funny reason they can control it ??We were staying half board which included buffet breakfast and buffet dinner. Yes the food was good but to be honest after 2 days it just became repetitive with just the odd thing being changed but it was more or less the same. I could not fault it though and all the guys that serve in the restaurant gave excellent customer service. The hotel is non smoking in the rooms which i appreciated as a non smoker. And your rooms have a Mosquitos mesh on them so if you don't like air con you can at least open the window and not be eaten alive.Location is great just turn left out of the hotel and you will find a great souvenir shop i cant give you the name as that would be unfair to the other shops but look for a red rose and ask for George. Tell him mike from London sent you and he is a star. Keep walking to the bottom of the hill and your in the town and the markets are all around you. Be safe and stay together and watch your wallets and pockets at all times.all in all it was a great hotel and i will stay again on my return to the holy land. Thanks you to all the staff and management (who are all male no female staff to be found anywhere) we all had a great time and thanks for the huge cake on our last night\n",

      "review_body : I stayed here travelling as a pilgrim along with 36 others in my group. I must admit, I was not looking forward to arriving, but upon arrival was pleasantly surprised. My room was a twin, ample space, on the 7th floor overlooking the back of Bethlehem. Room was more than adequate, very clean, beds and towels changed daily and we stayed here for 5 nights. Food was ok, it wasn't 5 star but nor was the hotel. We never went hungry.....breakfast was a choice of various salads, meat, boiled eggs, 2 days we got scrambled eggs which was a welcoming change! Toast/bread with various jams/spreads. Juice, tea/coffe and cereal and fruit, as much as you liked. Evening meal again, buffet style, plenty of salads, choice of usually 2 meats, rice, vegetables, potatoes and fresh fruit. The dining room was on the 8th floor with panoramic views of the whole of Bethlehem, outstanding! Showers were very powerful and hot water was plentiful. Air con in all rooms and was exceptional (included in price of stay, no extra charge) Staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a safety deposit box service but didn't use it.The hotel itself is not on a massive hill, yes it's a bit of a climb, but Bethlehem is not a flat town, it's all on a hill apart from Manger Square. The only downside for me, and it's not really a criticism, but the town seems very dirty, lots of graffiti everywhere and a lot of rubbish discarded in the streets, but apart from that, we loved the hotel and the town itself. Please remember, usually, if you are travelling to places like this, then you will probably be travelling as a pilgrim and not on holiday so don't expect a holiday resort!!The pictures that have been put on here from previous reviews are not doing the hotel justice. The hotel has had 2 new floors added to the top and this is where we stayed. We had no problems with this hotel and would definitely stay here again if the chance ever occured.\n",

      "review_body : The hotel is on one end of a steep road, without much parking place & very adjacent to the road . so from outside the front elevation is not impressive . But the interiors are well maintained & has all the basic amenities like- internet, overseas call service etc. The rooms are OK but the biggest problem was the too small size of bath room & toilette, which has to be modified at the earliest needs coffee kettle in all the rooms, the airconditioning & hot water supply has to be improved in most of the rooms, because if a big group checks -in ,there could be problems like this. For me The most liked aspect is the full view of Bethlehem city from the top 8 th floor where the food will be served. so over all my 2 night's stay was satisfactory.\n",

      "review_body : DONT STAY HERE EVER.1) I asked for a non-smoking room and the smoke would enter my room from all possible directions. The guy in the reception (who was a frutsrated idiot) did not think its a big problem. He wouldnt understand that I have health issues with smoke and did nothing to solve it. He was not even bothered to solve it. The neighbours were smoking and he said it is allowed for them to smoke in the passage (what rubbish was that) He said I must learn to adjust with the smoke. After I begged for a few hours, it took 2 hours for him to give me a bottle of room frehsner with very little freshner left in it. It got over after I sprayed a little and I asked for more and he said he doesnt have more (rude man could have gone and bought more from a shop). 2) I asked for a UK to Palestine plug convertor - instead of telling me sorry, its with some other room and we may be able to give in the next 2 or 4 or 15 hours....he said GO AND BUY IT FROM A SHOP. Later, the owner was surprised. He said they ofcourse have it and they did not udnerstand as to why did Mohamed not give it to me. (the reception guy was ONLY good to Arab tourists who spoke Arabic with him) 3) The wireless in my room was not working and I had to come to the SMOKY ground floor to use internet. The useless receptionish (same guy) did not even tell me how long will it take to repair. Just said you have to come to the lobby to use it. (the lobby where all were smoking) My main problem was above point 1 and 3.Oh, service was hopeless.\n",

It is not a 'plastic palace' like some of the more expensive Jerusalem Hotels, though the hotel have recently done a lot of work to improve the lobby / reception area. The service at the hotel is second to none! Nothing was too much trouble. The food and service in the dining room was excellent and the view is wonderful from the 5th floor restaurant. We had half board and our breakfasts and dinners were 5 star!!Thank you to the staff for making our pilgrimage so special.Joanne Cheltenham UK\n",

Rooms and all hotel very clean. The hotel is slightly run down and the food basic but plentiful. I stayed here 10 years ago and things are about the same (including some of the great staff) All in all a good place for visitors to Bethlehem to stay.

      "review_body : A basic hotel but would seem to be good value for money. The food was of a good standard and the customer care was also most acceptable. In fact it was much better than we experienced in other hotels in the region.The hotel does need to have money spent on it, as the bedrooms appear tired. The bathrooms are small and need to be updated. The rooms are quite noisy - due to movement within the hotel.Location was good just a short walk from the Church of the Nativity.We preferred this hotel to the one we stayed in Jerusalem which was more expensive and up to date.\n",

      "review_body : We just spent one night at the Bethlehem Star Hotel. We are a family of four (including two young kids) and we had a roomy quad with a clean bathroom and plenty of towels. (Only one person took a shower, so I cannot comment on hot water availability but it seemed fine.) The highlight of our room was the phenomenal view towards Manger Square and Herodium and Jordan in the distance. Wow. We bought some of the West Bank's Taybeh beer downstairs (it's quite good) and enjoyed it while gazing out our window. Worth every penny. The location was also terrific -- a short, interesting walk from the main sights. We reserved our room in advance by email and paid a lot more than the previous reviewer ($100 is what we paid). Should have read his review first and tried to bargain. Oh well! The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great (eggs, hummus and felafel, pita, vegetables, and regular toast and cereal for those who prefer). Our only mistake was to take them up on the suggestion to have dinner at the hotel. Our kids were tired, it was late, and a buffet one flight up from our room sounded good. Ugh. We had the worst meal of our trip (and we've been on the road for 4 months). It was frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fish and frozen vegetables -- all heated up, of course, but yuck. Stick to breakfast at the hotel and go to one of the many little restaurants nearby for dinner! Dinner aside, we give Bethlehem Star a big thumbs up.\n",

      "review_body : At 150 NIS (30 USD) per room a night, the Star is complete bargain as I think it’s extremely good value-for-money. I turned up without any reservations – having looked at the Grand Hotel next door (60 USD) and thought the Star was much better, and I was proved right. I was given a quad room, which was huge and had a commanding view of Bethlehem. It was clean, and quiet. The shower was very good, and bathroom was also very clean. The staff were pretty relaxed, and the breakfast was very good on the rooftop restaurant. Free wi-fi in reception (otherwise there’s a paid terminal nearby), and it’s not far from everything (10-minute walk or so to Manger Square, 10 mins to the number 21 Arab bus-stop for Jerusalem, 15 mins to the main bus station for serveees to other parts of the West Bank). There are also plenty of shops around so you can buy water or anything at all hours.Multichannel TV is a bit crap, but I’d happily stay there for a week if there were more things to do in the West Bank.\n",

Hotel staff, especially the night manager and dining room staff were so welcoming and friendly especially the night waiters and waitress were so nice to everyone that we felt at home. Triple rooms and double rooms were very comfortable and spacious.We all found the food was very well prepared and presented. Menus changed Everyday and we had a great time. I must admit that whilst we traversed the length and breadth of the Holy Land, we never feared anything and nothing happened to us.I strongly recommend this hotel, because it sits between Israel and Palestine.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here for 3 nights as part of a pilgrimage tour. Hotel needs maintenance. Caters to a lot of pilgrim tour groups with normally no choice. Would not have chosen this hotel for myself. Lots of complaints from our tour group relating to a/c, water pressure, rusty shampoo and body soap dispensers and food was so so. My friends and I love middle eastern food and are generally not picky eaters. We ate the food for fuel and lack of choice. Single type of fruit per meal. Coffee was instant. Hotel is not centrally located so we were not able to go out to find food ourselves.Management promptly corrected the room issues the following day. Food did not really improve. More training needed for hotel staff. Good: Beds were comfortable. Good to sleep in especially after all the activities. Best: Abundance of Persimmons when we were there. Sweet and yummy. Israel’s persimmons are the best I’ve tasted.Tip: Souvenir sellers will be at the hotel in the morning. Prices go down the longer you are in Bethlehem. \n",

      "review_body : I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, for several reasons: In the dining hall, the floor was covered in water from something that had spilled. Although the staff members present were aware of this, none of them dried it. One of the staff members told us to be careful because water was on the floor. A family member walked in, fell, injured their back, broke a bone in their spine, is going through physiotherapy sessions, CT scans, MRIs and X-rays, is in a lot pain because of this, and is going through a long recovery process. After this happened, this is when the staff decided to clean the floors. Their carelessness was not without consequence for us as visitors...this hotel is not recommended.Also, not all of the rooms are cleaned regularly. The food was repeated for 5 days.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here with my family for 3 nights and it was like home away from home. The place was clean through out and the staff were quite friendly and extremely accommodating. Loved the breakfast & Dinner buffet with a variety of delicious salads and a nice selection of cold and hot dishes. The hotel is frequented by many people either part of tour groups or weddings but despite that the place is kept up well. Our room had a nice layout, furniture and furnishings were clean and neat. I am very pleased with this hotel and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed for one night since we were guests at a wedding hosted at this hotel. The property had only been open for 7-8 months so everything was new and clean. Our room had two twin beds rather than a queen or king so that was disappointing. Otherwise the owners made a wise choice with the tile floors in the rooms, which will withstand the test of time and always look new. The bathroom was spacious with a great shower that didn't flood the bathroom, a rarity in the Middle East and Europe. We missed breakfast because it ended rather early (9:30 if memory serves) and wifi was tragically slow. I was able to get an LTE signal on my iPhone from a local carrier that was infinitely faster. This is the best hotel in Bethlehem by Western standards - I have stayed at 2 other hotels here - with the only caveat being its location. If you are traveling on your own and walking is difficult for you, know that it is a hilly 1 mile (1.6 km) walk to Manger Square. \n",

      "review_body : I stayed as part of a Conference and then added some extra days to look at places further afield. The rooms were well furnished, with tea/coffee making facilities and a fridge along with TV and hairdryer and individual temperature controls. It is new, and a few things need 'tweaking' but the staff were helpful and all the Reception staff with good English. The food was cooked well, but in some instances a little disappointing - although fruit is plentiful, there was little fresh fruit - tinned fruit cocktail for breakfast, and the range of cereals was limited. However, I'm sue over time, they will discover what types of foods would be preferred. I will defiantly go back again - the location was good and I never felt worried for my safety.\n",

      "review_body : I stayed at the Orient Palace Hotel in Bethlehem for five nights, as part of a group fo ten friends attending an international conference. The Orient Palace Hotel is a new property, and it shows a bit. Some areas were not complete (e.g., exercise room), and there was a plumbing problem with our room that required a move in the middle of our stay. That said, the staff simply went all out to make sure you were accommodated. The rooms we stayed in were very large and well appointed. The water pressure in the bathroom was great. The meals we took in the restaurant were fine, but in a five day conference stay, the menu did begin to appear to have a sameness after a bit. However, there was always excellent Arab coffee and the front desk personnel really looked after our group. I used the hotel laundry service, and while maybe a bit pricey, it was worth it. This is a good hotel that is on its way to becoming a great hotel.\n",

A 20 min walk to manger square through pleasant streets and alleys bursting with life - shops spilling onto streets with many different wares. The hotel is recently constructed and there will at some stage be a Gym. At present there is a pleasant outdoor sitting area close to some olive trees and a bar. The rooms are nicely done with all of the usual trimmings of a 3-4* hotel, decent comfortable beds, and the food and buffet-style restaurant quality and service more than adequate.\n",

It turned out that he'd spent about 9 years of his youth in Rotherham before returning to Palestine, now married with two children. He was very proud that he served many of the Royal Family when working at the Equestrian Centre in Greenwich for the Olympics. He made us feel very welcome. He also helpfully advised us not to visit a local site, Jacob's Well, as there was trouble in that area that particular day (refugee camp nearby and a regular flashpoint). We felt well looked after.This is not a luxury hotel but our room and ensuite bathroom was a good size, clean and perfectly adequate. We were offered dinner but had already arranged to go out. Breakfast was a big spread of typical Palestinan food.\n",

The property itself is not in the best condition, and as typical in the West Bank, the water pressure is poor. Thankfully, there was hot water, but the low pressure made it difficult to shower. The breakfast was one of the best we had in the West Bank with hot, toasted bread with Za'atar and cheese brought out from the kitchen to the table. They also cooked eggs to order. As mentioned previously, the evening hotel clerk (Faras?) was outstanding. He was especially helpful when we arrived and our taxi driver needed to get back to East Jerusalem. The people throughout the West Bank were very friendly and helfpul and I would recommend the Hotel Al Qasr if you visit Nablus.\n",

      "review_body : This is a delightful small hotel, and very welcoming. All the staff I met were warm and welcoming and they wanted to do everything possible to please guests. Feras, working behind the desk when I arrived, ended his shift shortly afterwards and offered to take me round town -- thank you so much for your kindness. I had a great time seeing parts of the Old City I would not have otherwise discovered.My room was just fine and breakfast was great -- once more, with everyone in attendance wanting to please. Nablus is a great city to visit, and this is a wonderful hotel to stay at.\n",

The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the service was very good.I ordered room service twice, and it is great value for money. Food was very taste and well prepared.Breakfast was very good, all local products (no English breakfast).Staff was very helpful and they provide a superb service.The only down-side is that the wifi signal in the room was very weak. If you sit on the sofa in the corridor or get down to the lobby, the signal was good.\n",

      "review_body : Let me begin by saying that I've traveled internationally quite a bit and I've never visited a city that was safer or more friendly than Nablus. My wife and I ended up staying for three days and would have stayed longer if schedule had allowed. Highlight was taking a cooking class provided by the Bait al Karama women's program (see my review on TripAdvisor).Hotel Al Qasr embodied all that we experienced in Nablus. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful...the rooms were quiet and clean. It's by no means a 5-star facility but the staff is 6-star. The hotel is equidistant between the old city and the trendy part of town with restaurants...about 15min walking either direction or a 10 shekel cab ride for two. I look forward to visiting Al Qasr again soon.\n",

The room we got was really spacious with a place to relax,it had en-suite , it was very clean, the furniture a wee bit old fashioned but comfortable.The food was traditional ,it had a large open oven which the chef prepared hot food daily. Good to see ! I got a bit fed up of the food at times and the staff offered me alternatives which was really good service . The hotel is in the popular area of Rafeedia with lots of shops and restaurants which stay open late. The hotel is on a bit of a hill so be prepared to climb, but after dinner you lose the pounds. The Terrace on the roof is amazing , with fantastic views over Nablus. You can walk to the town centre , a pleasant walk but recommend a taxi back. All in all a very good hotel and would return no problem.\n",

One feels comfortable staying in clean and spacious rooms. I really got peaceful sleep at nights snuggling under the clean sheets of the cozy bed. There was a television with quite a lot of channels. But I hardly used it. The decent sized modern bathrooms look great. There are all necessary amenities and enough amounts of toiletries supplied. I deeply appreciate the free Wifi provided by this hotel. One would not complain about this place after enjoying its five star service. It is definitely worth the money paid.\n",

They get in water but when it runs out they have to use water the rest of gazans have to drink which is briny and salty. Air con operates when there is power or when there is fuel for the deisel generators (Israelis bombed the power station.) You can watch people swimming in the sea from the window of your room but you know they are swimming in raw sewrage as Israel bombed the sewrage treatment plant and now the sewrage from all of Gaza is pumped raw into the sea. The staff who work there are professional and the service is good. The rooms are large and clean, the bathroom great. I hope one day that the Commadore will be able to be the 5 star operation it is built to be.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed at the Commodore for just a few days and wish it could have been longer. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and like Palestinians everywhere, they were all unbelievably friendly.Pretty much anyone going to Gaza is going there with the UN or other aid organisations and will not be surprised but in case the borders get opened anytime soon I'll add a few things people should realise before checking in.Gaza's water situation is dire, so expect a brackish shower and use bottled water to brush your teeth. You'll be a million times better off for water than anyone who lives in Gaza but just don't drink it.Sewage treatment in Gaza has been difficult to say the least since the Israeli bombardment destroyed the treatment plant so you also need to bin your TP as much as possible rather than flushing it.That covered the room was huge, bathroom was spotless and beds comfortable and there was a tonne of satellite TV channels available in room. Most of the rooms have views over Gaza beach and the beautiful Mediterranean.The staff will help with anything you need and despite the difficulties everyone living in Gaza faces, the service here is better than anywhere. Truly 5 star service (the manager will unplug his laptop to enable you to use the free WIFI if you didn't bring your own) Only downside is the guilt factor involved when staying somewhere that very very few Gazans could hope to afford, though that's common when traveling outside ones Western comfort zone.\n",

      "review_body : Excellent hotel despite its location inside a prison. At the time of my stay, Google Maps does not list a transliteration (Al Mashtal) or translation (Arboretum Hotel) of the hotel name, so it's a little hard to find. The hotel is located at 31.5456N, 34.4550E, across the street from the former Blue Beach Resort. Great front desk service (the differentiator of all fine hotels). Staff were pleasant and fluent speakers of English.Lovely ornamentation in the entrance. Great food (both dinner and breakfast) in the restaurant. Superlative views of the Mediterranean from its sea-side location. Biggest problem is the hassle of getting through security at the Erez border crossing, especially leaving Gaza. It adds new meaning to the lyrics \"You can check out, but can never leave.\"It's a miracle that the staff perform so well given their limited commercial supplies and access to the outside world. I hope to stay there again.\n",

The swimming pool was so dirty and they told us it's included when we first checked in but when we tried to use it in the morning they said we are not allowed to because it's too dirty! 3. Gym and Spa were closed because there is a shortage in electricity & workers. 4. We tried their restaurant in the evening, the workers were shouting to each others as if we are in an open market. 5. In the morning around the dirty swimming pool a man was shouting so loud in his phone and talking dirty words in Arabic from close distance to us, we discovered later that he is a manager in this place! Simply don't go to this place it's a nightmare.\n",

Because Gaza is under siege, rooms are always available. In the event that Israel issues you a permit to visit Gaza, this is an excellent choice to stay. Rooms are very reasonable, especially for a seaside hotel.\n",

      "review_body : I stayed here for 2 weeks on business in January 2013 and was very impressed. The staff are lovely.. helpful and curious. I made genuine friends among them.The hotel was built as a loss-leader.. to kickstart the Gazan economy and give people something to be proud of. Its restaurant is always full. I was there on Valentines day which was a very eye-opening experience.. It was too cold for the pool when I was there, but it looks fantastic and i hear theyre even planning beachfront villas.Its easily the best-appointed hotel in Gaza city and the view of Gazas most beautiful mosque with the sea and Israel in the background really took my breath away.The food isnt great by Gaza standards, but there are so many fantastic restaurants in Gaza that you really have no excuse for eating in the hotel (other than security I guess!).Best of all was the spa.. free to guests and a real treat at the end of a long work trip.\n",

However the pool was restricted for women which was the biggest disadvantage as the pool is so inviting and one of the main attractions of the hotel. The food was ok a bit overpriced. All in all the people of Gaza try to make the most and best of what they have and I would stay here again.\n",

      "review_body : ArcMed's rooms are so comfortable that they will make you feel as if you were in some resort on the Southern European coast. That's actually part of the problem: the place lacks charm, you could be anywhere. The hotel does not have the patina of famed Al Deira. Due to the blockade, the hotel is almost empty, save for some aid workers journalists staying there.Other problems include lack of access to the swimming pool for women, due to strict conservatism in Gaza, and poor service at the restaurant - even it the staff is friendly, they have not been trained properly yet (the blockade makes it impossible to send people to be trained in Egypt ot the West Bank for instance). The restaurant serves rather good Italian food, though shortage of ingredients due to the blockade can be felt.\n",

Wonderful feeling - if you have friends living nearby - who do NOT have such a benefit. Never mind - its a nice place to stay over when in Gaza, food is good (sometimes a bit slow in the mornings). But I prefer the fish restaurant next door - you choose your own (fresh!) fish at the shop - and they'll take it to the restaurant for you :-).Al Deira has huge and spacious rooms - and a bathtub that one needs to get used to.

When you also have yo work, its great to be in a comfortable room with the view and sound of the sea.Obs, if there is a wedding and you are a man.

      "review_body : Al Deira Hotel in Gaza is something of a classic, even though it isn't 20 years old. Built with a strong Moroccan theme throughout, it is charming. And the view of the sea from the restaurant terrace and some of the rooms simply cannot be beat. The staff are lovely, warm and welcoming. Service in the restaurant is slow - don't hope for a quick meal - but what they lack in efficiency, they make up for in simple good manners. The rooms are clean, well appointed, and comfortable - cool in summer and warm in winter. Everything you need is at hand. Bathrooms are spacious, but the Deira can't escape the fact that it is in Gaza and so the water is saline.Due to Gaza's poor electricity supply, a huge generator ran right outside my window the whole time I was there, but it meant that I had unimpinged electricity. The thick walls and well constructed windows meant that the room was quiet as long as I didn't open the window.\n",

      "review_body : The Al Deira is a favourite for journalists and some NGO folks as it is considered safe (e.g. from strikes as the Israelis have the coordinates and therefore do not target). That is important. The hotel itself is quite pricey, despite being in Gaza city, largely because of what I noted above. So firstly, we stayed in room 13 which is considered a suite. There were 2 bedrooms, a large living area and okay sized bathroom and a loft area upstairs which really was more of a waste of space (possible you could sleep more people up there). There was also a fridge but not a kitchenette. There is wi-fi in the room but you need to be patient as it is not consistent. There is a restaurant which is facing the sea and has fairly decent food. There are downsides to the hotel and I will mention a few here. Breakfast in the morning will really depend on the number of people staying--the more people, they do a buffet. If not, then they give you a standard plate of eggs and some bread and you need to ask for extras. It is fine, but getting a waiter to take an order can be a chore as in the morning, they seem to be permanently understaffed. In the evening, the restaurant buzzes and service much better and okay food. The staff in general, are very good. However, one thing to note is that if you get a room facing the main road it is crazy noisy, so try and get one to the back. 13 has one room which is large and faces the front and one that is smaller that is a bit protected from the street noise. It can be very loud, so again if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs and request a backroom. Also note that the wi-fi is not free, except for the restaurant. Otherwise, it is $5 a day. For other information on Gaza, message me.\n",

      "review_body : Lovely hotel located right above the sea, designed like a Moroccan palace and decorated with antiques shopped in Gaza and the Middle-East. This is Gaza's most expensive hotel. The outdoor restaurant, located right over the beach, serves very nice food and is a haunt for foreign correspondents, international aid workers and rich, secular Gazans at night. Smoking sheesha on that terrace is an absolute must, and so is eating the shrimps in a clay pot dish. Lovely staff, lovely atmosphere and laid-back luxury which might come as a surprise in a place as poor as Gaza. They even managed to open a bookshop which sells all the must-read on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n",

      "review_body : The most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in. Despite Israel's blockade of Gaza, the hotel management and staff somehow managed to make us feel welcome and even pampered. Electricity sometimes failed because of the blockade. The rooms are beautiful -- all different. Bathrooms also different and delightful. A little cracked plaster here and there, and peeling paint,, but again this is due to the blockade rather than neglect by owners.I can't wait to go back to Gaza and to the Al Deira Hotel.\n",

The rooms are huge and spacious and the high ceilings and arc's make you feel like you are in a palace. The bathroom was nice, and there was lots of hot water. They have wireless internet for a fee, and the room had a great seating area and desk, a TV with satellite and a minibar. It was very quiet and relaxing. We had a resevation in advance and the price I paid for one room for one night was $100 US. I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

      "review_body : We spent a week in Gaza City at the Al Deira Hotel. Our room had a sea view with windows and sliding glass doors to allow in the lapping (and a few times roaring) waves. The room was well furnished, the bed extremely comfortable, plenty of hot water, and fantastic room service. While the food is expensive in comparison to local prices, it is not unreasonable given the proportions. We had dinner there 3 evenings and tried different dishes each night...all were delicious. Breakfast comes with the reservation, something we didn't know and all meals can be delivered to your room. This would be advisable if you do not like the smoke from the traditional pipes. While the wireless connection did not work in our room, we just took out laptop out into the hallway where there was a sitting area and we had no problems. Last if you want to work out and you are foreign, you can wander down the road about a block on the same side of the road as the Al Deira and find the UN Beach club. You need to sign in and then you can use the very basic gym. Or you can go to Rozi's which is also basic and woman can attend only 10:30-6:00 and men before and after this time. Remember you are still in Gaza City.\n",

      "review_body : Alexander Hotel is where Europe meets the Mideast. The owner, Joseph is American citizens that followed his dream in retirement and went back to his place of birth, Bethlehem, and build his own hotel. Do not we all dream one day to go back to the old country and do something good? He also par Italian. The hotel design, service, food, and the warm welcoming environment are much like hotels in France or Italy with a nice touch of middle eastern flavor. There is nothing better than coming back from long day of touring and feel the warmth of Joseph or his son Joey or any staff member. You feel like went back to home sweet home to relax and get recharged for the next day of touring, or just relaxing. I stayed on seven stars hotels, paid as much as $1,200 a night. Of course there it was fine in very accept for the down home feeling. I had the feeling that I was staying in a museum not a nice comfy hotel room. Make yourself a promise; visit the Holy Land, Jerusalem and Bethlehem. It will be the trip of a live time, not like any other place you have been to. And for sure stay in Alexander Hotel in Bethlehem. Once you make your reservation, call Joseph or Joey direct or email, ask them anything you need to know in advance of your travel. Let them know when you will arrive, for sure, like they did with me, they will be waiting for you with open arms and a cup of coffie or hot tea. Enjoy.\n",

It is centrally located in Bethlehem with easy access to the Church of the Nativity, Shepherd's Field, and to some of the best shopping in the area.

      "review_body : Amazing hospitality at the Alexander Hotel! I visited Bethlehem several times and always stayed at the Alexander hotel due to its friendly and welcoming staff that treat you like family and offer great services for very affordable rates. In addition, the hotel is strategically located in the heart of Bethlehem, making it within walking distance to most parts of town, especially Manger Square (Church of Nativity) which is only 10 minutes away. There are many local shops and restaurants in this area that are open late and very welcoming to tourists and foreigners. Alternatively, the Alexander Hotel also has delicious food that is offered with generous portions at modest prices. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking of making a trip to Bethlehem and I would encourage them to spend a couple of nights there to truly experience all that this great town has to offer!\n",

The location is quite convenient (less than 10 mins walk from Manger Square). Rooms are basic but have everything needed. There is enough breakfast to feed an army. This time we had to make an early start and they did breakfast specially. Nothing is too much trouble, and if you want to hear about Bethlehems recent history, and the way of life of Christian Palestinians, this family will tell all.

This family-owned hotel is very nice and clean, the rooms are very standard and so is the food, but what really does the trick is the extraordinary hospitality of the family. They will go through great lengths to make you feel welcome and help you with whatever challenges you may have. The son, Joseph, would even drive us to his favorite Betlehem restaurant in his own car, and we often spent the nights talking to the father and listening to his stories over a (free) cup of whatever in the hotel lobby. Also the prices are more than reasonable.\n",

Josef and Ivana were very warm, eager to help me feel at home, They succeeded! The rooms were small but comfortable for one or for a couple. There were some needed repairs that were completed while we were there. The breakfast was a good, Middle Eastern breakfast. If we wished for anything, Ivana did her best to provide. The lobby was nicely renovated and was a comfortable place to meet other guests in the evening. The location was convenient for my stay: a 20 minute walk to manger square, near the Bethlehem Hotel and the road heading out to Beit Sahour. We felt very safe throughout Bethlehem. I thoroughly enjoyed the warm, Palestinian hospitality. The Alexander Hotel's website photos show the hotel well.\n",

      "review_body : The location of this hotel was great! The accommodations were OK. The bed sheets and towels were stained and very worn. The sitting area near our room was always dirty with trash all around. Disappointed that the pool was closed due to construction/renovations. The staff was friendly and kind although at times it was hard to communicate due to the language barrier.\n",

      "review_body : Possibly the worst accommodation I have found throughout all my travels. Where do I start, apart from being the only guests which always rings an alarm bell, the accommodation was far from adequate. All 4 beds in our room had not been changed, empty water bottles and rubbish were found under the beds.Part of the ceiling was covered in black mould, and part of the coving was precariously held up with sellotape. There was no toilet paper at all and the bathroom door handle was missing?! The whole hotel was freezing cold with a room heater that was either off or stuck at 28 degrees with no adjustment, this would explain the receptionist (the only member of staff on site) wearing their coat!!The water and juice bottles supplied at breakfast were opened and part empty, again suggesting they were not fresh. On raising our concerns with the receptionist we were told the bottled water had been refilled with tap water which was fresh and that was an appropriate local practice??! It was clear the hotel had closed down and opened just for our stay. The swimming pool was empty of water and full of rubble and outside area was a building site!!Whether you are on a budget or not, do not stay here!! \n",

      "review_body : Just your average cheap hotel, except that it's not exactly cheap... This is due to the lack of offer in Ramallah, which is reflected in prices generally high compared to the quality offered. The room was large but really rundown. The hotel itself was dark and freezing cold (luckily our room had heating though). We didn't try the breakfast.A definite plus was the receptionist, he was really kind and gave us lots of advice and offered us free coffee and tea upon checkout as we didn't make it in time to have breakfast. Also, the location is very convenient, a few minutes walk from the main square. All in all, considering what's on offer in Ramallah, it's not a bad option.\n",

My credit card didn't work at check-in, but he allowed me to stay there anyway and pay at checkout instead. The room was nothing special, but it was clean and the mattress was comfortable enough for me. The location is great. You can walk to Arafat Square as well as a handful of restaurants/bars (Find a place with Taybeh beer. It's brewed in the West Bank.). The breakfast was hummus, pita and plenty of fixings. In my entire stay there, I never saw another guest except for a wedding party that was in the ballroom one night. If you're going to Ramallah, I recommend the Casablanca Hotel\n",

We were given a very nice room that was almost like an apartment with a sitting area, queen bed, kitchenette (fridge, sink) and bathroom. Breakfast was great and the staff was amazing. As is typical in this region, the shower made the entire bathroom wet and bed was not the most comfortable (but better than many). Location can't be beat - quiet and feels neighborhood-y, but a less than five minute walk to the center circles. Would stay here again!\n",

      "review_body : This is probably the best hotel at the city. It is at a central location that allows easy access to the city market, central streets and restaurants. The rooms and services are similar to any European or American standard. The hotel includes a large meeting room. The restaurant of the hotel is simply great and features a large variety of middle eastern and western western dishes. The hotel and restaurant appears to attract out of town visitors for weekends and the restaurant. The hotel is family friendly. Most importantly the hotel staff is very kind, friendly and professional. The hotel is clean and the rooms are spacious enough. Smoking is allowed in common areas and in the rooms.\n",

In a busy street not far away from the city center, the old city and the old market. Nice big rooms, nicely decorated. Not always extremely clean but never dirty. Very kind and helpful personel, but with no english language knowledge with some exceptions. A very good, and high quality restaurant in the second floor where you can take your breakfast as well. Poor breakfast.After all if you have to visit the city of Nablus is a nice hotel for the money you spend.\n",

      "review_body : Considering what's available, and if you are looking for a high standard, especially if you are a planning a long term stay, this is the best you will find in Ramallah. The rooms are clean, room service is surprisingly fast, and the restaurant (Fakir El Din - Palestinian food) is very good. While there are lots of things that are not quite right, the one's that were most disappointing to me were the poorly maintained gym (it was completely unusable to me), lack of English speaking staff (only the front desk was completely communicative), and the fact that the pool seemed less for hotel guests and more for weekend weddings (some days the staging completely took over the pool area) and the children in the community (I felt like I was in the middle of a playground). If another 5 star were to open in Ramallah, I'd give it a try before staying at this place again. That being said, a stay at the Grand Park Hotel, when you consider the competition, is doing a reasonably good job.\n",

It felt wonderful to go to the room after a long drive!!.Yes, the corridors were long and numerous. But the hotel management had sign posted the way for easy access. The lift doors closed quickly, a hazard for all passengers! Service was quick and and the rooms were huge!

      "review_body : We stayed at this hotel for four days in June. It is one of the biggest hotels in Bethlehem and in my opinion too big. It is a hotel without atmosphere. The lobby is big with many corners and with a bar. A lot of pilgrim groups from all over the world is coming and going all the time. The rooms are big but ours was not clean. Dust was laying in the corners. The selection of food served from a buffet was not big and almost the same every day.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here for 16 days and liked the hotel a lot. The staff is really friendly and helps you with almost everything. I stayed at the 11th floor where there are balconys. I recommend this if it is possible. Great view over Bethlehem! The rooms are big, clean and tidy. There is a safe and a big closet for your clothes. The showers are nice and the bathroom clean. I would recommend staying here.The only negative about the hotel is that there are many travellers coming in buses. Which means that there can be some noise early in the morning when people are leaving. Also the breakfeast room can be crowded in the morning! But the hotel has a good system where you get Your own table and it works pretty well.\n",

I recommend this if it is possible. Great view over Bethlehem! The rooms are big, clean and tidy. There is a safe and a big closet for your clothes. The showers are nice and the bathroom clean. I would recommend staying here.The only negative about the hotel is that there are many travellers coming in buses. Which means that there can be some noise early in the morning when people are leaving. Also the breakfeast room can be crowded in the morning! But the hotel has a good system where you get Your own table and it works pretty well.\n",

      "review_body : We stayed at this hotel for four days in June. It is one of the biggest hotels in Bethlehem and in my opinion too big. It is a hotel without atmosphere. The lobby is big with many corners and with a bar. A lot of pilgrim groups from all over the world is coming and going all the time. The rooms are big but ours was not clean. Dust was laying in the corners. The selection of food served from a buffet was not big and almost the same every day.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here for 16 days and liked the hotel a lot. The staff is really friendly and helps you with almost everything. I stayed at the 11th floor where there are balconys. I recommend this if it is possible. Great view over Bethlehem! The rooms are big, clean and tidy. There is a safe and a big closet for your clothes. The showers are nice and the bathroom clean. I would recommend staying here.The only negative about the hotel is that there are many travellers coming in buses. Which means that there can be some noise early in the morning when people are leaving. Also the breakfeast room can be crowded in the morning! But the hotel has a good system where you get Your own table and it works pretty well.\n",

      "review_body : Stayed here for 16 days and liked the hotel a lot. The staff is really friendly and helps you with almost everything. I stayed at the 11th floor where there are balconys. I recommend this if it is possible. Great view over Bethlehem! The rooms are big, clean and tidy. There is a safe and a big closet for your clothes. The showers are nice and the bathroom clean. I would recommend staying here.The only negative about the hotel is that there are many travellers coming in buses. Which means that there can be some noise early in the morning when people are leaving. Also the breakfeast room can be crowded in the morning! But the hotel has a good system where you get Your own table and it works pretty well.\n",

      "review_body : We had previously stayed at another, much less salubrious (being kind) hotel in Bethlehem, so it was with some trepidation that I returned to the town to try again-albeit at a different establishment. I was very pleased to note that 90% of our experience at the Holy Family Hotel was excellent. The rooms were very clean and comfortable; staff were extremely friendly and helpful; the off-street parking easily accessible; the wifi in the rooms had a strong signal; and, the noise at night was minimal despite being opposite a busy bus terminal.Some things that could improve include: trying to limit the smoking in the lobby/bar area (although this is a problem all over the ME); and, having at least one English language TV channel - such as BBC or al-Jezeera. These are very small issues, but would have made my stay even better.\n",

      "review_body : The Hotel is of a good standard, with an open and welcoming atrium. The dining room is clean, with buffet style food which is locally sourced, and very tasty. The Menu in Palestinian type food, which we found very tasty and very healthy. It is only a few minutes walk to Manger Square, and the Church of the Nativity. Also quite close to the Shepherds Fields. There is much to see and learn in this area of Palestine. The local people are very gentle and dignified, and striving to make their lives as reasonable as possible under very difficult conditions.\n",

      "review_body : We are a group of 46 persons to visit Holy Lands of Israel (Riya Holidays from Kerala, India), reached Holy Family Hotel for 3 days stay on the evening of 12th Sept 2016. I shared room with one other person of this group. On the first day itself we noticed that toilet flush is not working well, but we understand that it is actually more worse when we used it in the next morning. I reported to the reception and even if they promised it was not fixed in the next evening. Then they give us another promise that our room will be changed the next day, since no other rooms are available at present. When we reached next day evening I went to the reception to know the new room number. But they are saying that the problem is fixed and we can continue on the same room itself. But when we checked the toilet nothing is fixed and its condition is worse to its extreme. We were not able to use the toilet properly for the last two days and so we were suffereing like hell. On the first day they were trying to blame us saying that we put the toilet papers on the flush and so the problem arised. But we are facing this problem even before we actually using this toilet. Then I went to the reception and said, but they are still saying that no other rooms are availble now. Then I shouted with them and they immediately given us a new room. We both experienced a terrible days at this hotel without using the toilet for 2 days. I feel like staff are not even caring about even the basic needs of a guest there.\n",

The rooms were very clean and comfortable; staff were extremely friendly and helpful; the off-street parking easily accessible; the wifi in the rooms had a strong signal; and, the noise at night was minimal despite being opposite a busy bus terminal.Some things that could improve include: trying to limit the smoking in the lobby/bar area (although this is a problem all over the ME); and, having at least one English language TV channel - such as BBC or al-Jezeera.

      "review_body : We are a group of 46 persons to visit Holy Lands of Israel (Riya Holidays from Kerala, India), reached Holy Family Hotel for 3 days stay on the evening of 12th Sept 2016. I shared room with one other person of this group. On the first day itself we noticed that toilet flush is not working well, but we understand that it is actually more worse when we used it in the next morning. I reported to the reception and even if they promised it was not fixed in the next evening. Then they give us another promise that our room will be changed the next day, since no other rooms are available at present. When we reached next day evening I went to the reception to know the new room number. But they are saying that the problem is fixed and we can continue on the same room itself. But when we checked the toilet nothing is fixed and its condition is worse to its extreme. We were not able to use the toilet properly for the last two days and so we were suffereing like hell. On the first day they were trying to blame us saying that we put the toilet papers on the flush and so the problem arised. But we are facing this problem even before we actually using this toilet. Then I went to the reception and said, but they are still saying that no other rooms are availble now. Then I shouted with them and they immediately given us a new room. We both experienced a terrible days at this hotel without using the toilet for 2 days. I feel like staff are not even caring about even the basic needs of a guest there.\n",

The Hotel staff is wonderful, the facilities are clean and it is just a short 2 min walk to the church of the Nativity and Manger Square. The free wifi is also a plus! Thank you Holy Family Hotel for doing such an amazing job!\n",

Food is very tasty, we had half board and they have buffet style. The selection was rich. Rooms are not so large, bathroom with shower. But they are comfortable and very clean.\n",

Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that.

The rooms were large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom, Coffee and Tea facilities were available but we needed to bring up greasy milk from the breakfast room each morning- staff happy with this.Average choice of food for breakfast but good for the evening meal, and staff in the dining room very pleasant.Luggage transported to and from coach if left outside of room at a specific time.Allow plenty of time if you are visiting the church as queues may be 2hrs. Well worth the wait but if the visit time is chosen early, not quite so long.Enjoyable stay.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group of thirty pilgrims. Good location near to Manger Square and more importantly for us, very close to the Church of the Nativity. The rooms were large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom, Coffee and Tea facilities were available but we needed to bring up greasy milk from the breakfast room each morning- staff happy with this.Average choice of food for breakfast but good for the evening meal, and staff in the dining room very pleasant.Luggage transported to and from coach if left outside of room at a specific time.Allow plenty of time if you are visiting the church as queues may be 2hrs. Well worth the wait but if the visit time is chosen early, not quite so long.Enjoyable stay.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

The rooms were large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom, Coffee and Tea facilities were available but we needed to bring up greasy milk from the breakfast room each morning- staff happy with this.Average choice of food for breakfast but good for the evening meal, and staff in the dining room very pleasant.Luggage transported to and from coach if left outside of room at a specific time.Allow plenty of time if you are visiting the church as queues may be 2hrs. Well worth the wait but if the visit time is chosen early, not quite so long.Enjoyable stay.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

The rooms were large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom, Coffee and Tea facilities were available but we needed to bring up greasy milk from the breakfast room each morning- staff happy with this.Average choice of food for breakfast but good for the evening meal, and staff in the dining room very pleasant.Luggage transported to and from coach if left outside of room at a specific time.Allow plenty of time if you are visiting the church as queues may be 2hrs. Well worth the wait but if the visit time is chosen early, not quite so long.Enjoyable stay.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

The rooms were large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom, Coffee and Tea facilities were available but we needed to bring up greasy milk from the breakfast room each morning- staff happy with this.Average choice of food for breakfast but good for the evening meal, and staff in the dining room very pleasant.Luggage transported to and from coach if left outside of room at a specific time.Allow plenty of time if you are visiting the church as queues may be 2hrs. Well worth the wait but if the visit time is chosen early, not quite so long.Enjoyable stay.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group of thirty pilgrims. Good location near to Manger Square and more importantly for us, very close to the Church of the Nativity. The rooms were large and comfortable with a spacious bathroom, Coffee and Tea facilities were available but we needed to bring up greasy milk from the breakfast room each morning- staff happy with this.Average choice of food for breakfast but good for the evening meal, and staff in the dining room very pleasant.Luggage transported to and from coach if left outside of room at a specific time.Allow plenty of time if you are visiting the church as queues may be 2hrs. Well worth the wait but if the visit time is chosen early, not quite so long.Enjoyable stay.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

      "review_body : Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that. Wifi only really worked in the lobby areas and with a big group and lots of luggage the lifts became an issue as one had to wait for ages to get one. Mostly used stairs but clearly that's not available to everyone. Luggage was transported to and from our coach which was helpful.\n",

      "review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. We were met by the friendly front desk agent, Rana, and our check-in was seamless. We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

      "review_body : This is a very nice hotel in good location. The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

      "review_body : This is a very nice hotel in good location. The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

      "review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. We were met by the friendly front desk agent, Rana, and our check-in was seamless. We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

      "review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. We were met by the friendly front desk agent, Rana, and our check-in was seamless. We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

      "review_body : This is a very nice hotel in good location. The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

      "review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. We were met by the friendly front desk agent, Rana, and our check-in was seamless. We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

      "review_body : This is a very nice hotel in good location. The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

      "review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. We were met by the friendly front desk agent, Rana, and our check-in was seamless. We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : This is a very nice hotel in good location. The rooms are large enough and the one I had also had a nice refrigerator, coffee pot, and a hot plate with some kitchen utensils as well. The room was kept clean and well maintained. There is small balcony with the rooms facing to Jafa Street. The bathroom was rather small and no space to put your toiletries. The breakfast is quite good, but basically the same every day. There is plenty to eat and selection is good. There is good restaurant onsite as well, Vintage, that has good menu and Sushi some nights. The only problem that I encountered is having a room facing the Jafa street and the intersection is that is a lot of traffic noise at all hours. Recommend you get a room facing the back side of the hotel.\n",

      "review_body : Tripadvisor currently rate the Royal Court 2nd out of 9 Ramallah hotels, but it has to be the best located. If you think of the town as a right-tilted triangle, with the modern centre as the apex, the old town as the left base angle and the new development and posh hotels in the right base angle, the RC is dead in the middle of the base. You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city. If I ever return, I'll look no further.\n",

      "review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. We were met by the friendly front desk agent, Rana, and our check-in was seamless. We stayed at a lot of hotels in Israel and NONE of them thought to paperclip our visas to our passports but Rana did! She is genius! We'll come to Royal Court first next time. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need. We had a little kitchenette which comes in handy when you're shopping for goodies around town. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The hotel is very close to the center of town and the room had a great view of a garden at the new building across the street (city hall?) The lobby restaurant, Vintage, is very well done. It's a modern cafe with a well-composed menu. It had classic Arabic food plus more westernized options so it fits anyone's palate.We had a very yummy lunch there. The breakfast was amazing!! The breakfast at Royal Court was the best breakfast we had at any hotel on our trip. They were installing a small sushi/Thai restaurant and I wish I could have tried it; bet it was gooooood!\n",

While it might not have some of the small touches that make Movenpick hotels great, I enjoyed my stay at the Millennium. The staff was kind, helpful, and efficient and the rooms are comfortable. I thought the food was very good and the wifi was free and accessible throughout the hotel. There is also a well equipped gym and a nice outdoor pool area. I also liked that you could walk to several local restaurants. I plan on staying here again the next time I visit Ramallah.\n",

      "review_body : Previously known as the Mövenpick, this hotel is still finding its feet as the Millennium. Good selection for breakfast and friendly staff. Travelling as a group, we had a triple room. Two normal beds and one fold-up squeaky mattress, better suited for a child. Two towels for three, two sets of everything... On closer inspection, the fold up bed only had a bottom sheet, no duvet either, just a blanket. We requested a change of bed, another sheet and received an extra blanket. Tough night. The following day a new request received a proper mattress put on the floor. Still no second sheet. A new request produced the desired item, brought like a trophy on arms outstretched. Only problem - still washing machine fresh. Soaking. After a further 24 hours, it was finally ready for use. Apart from that, a lovely place. Try the supermarket a few paces downhill and the superior cake shop!\n",

There is no hair dryer in your room and the ones you can borrow in the lobby don't work. A lot of people stay here because of the pilgrimages, so there will be crowds, noise and the elevators full all the time. At the breakfast, they don't have coffee, only some bad tasting granulated one- instant coffee. You are asked to pay for the real one. I've never experienced a 4 stars hotel not having coffee. It is essential! They don't have fresh juices, barely any fruit. The food is okay and edible, but not tasting too well. They don't let you stay wherever you want in the restaurant, the waiters will arrange you depending on their motives. \n",

I'm not sure exactly how much we paid because it was all part of the package. But it was a good 3* level or service. The rooms were fine and there was a room for our group of 26 to have our meeting every evening. There was plenty to suit all tastes at the breakfast and evening buffets. The only two negative features were the fruit juices at breakfast, which were very poor; and the hot beverages, which were just coffee granules at breakfast (the cups being kept separate from the hot water for some reason) or only available at the bar in the evening. The staff were friendly and the business appeared to be Christian-run. The town was bigger than I remember and the centre appeared to be more than easy walking distance away.\n",

      "review_body : I went to the Holy Land in a group tour and we stayed at the Nativity. The staff couldn't be more friendly. They try to speak as many languages as they can, most speak at least some portuguese (my native language). The highlight of the staff is Nichola, who seems to do a bit of everything in the hotel and is always ready to help. My mother fell sick on our last day of stay in the middle of the night. We had about four hours before a very early flight. My mother had a fever and was throwing up. Because of the short time for rest, I tried not to wake up the tour leader. I asked Nicholas for help and he arranged for a doctor that arrived there in 5 minutes, at 1AM. The doctor gave her shots and even gave me a ride to a 24 hours pharmacy for the medicines she would need and thankfully we were able to travel. Nichola was like an angel that night.Also the location is great, lots of shops around, even a very good bakery, a nice bar, a supermarket and a delicious ice cream.\n",

      "review_body : This hotel is surely not a 4* one. 2 1/2-3. The staff is okay, friendly. The rooms are big and clean, but the sheets and towels are not changed during your visit. There is no hair dryer in your room and the ones you can borrow in the lobby don't work. A lot of people stay here because of the pilgrimages, so there will be crowds, noise and the elevators full all the time. At the breakfast, they don't have coffee, only some bad tasting granulated one- instant coffee. You are asked to pay for the real one. I've never experienced a 4 stars hotel not having coffee. It is essential! They don't have fresh juices, barely any fruit. The food is okay and edible, but not tasting too well. They don't let you stay wherever you want in the restaurant, the waiters will arrange you depending on their motives. \n",

      "review_body : We stayed four nights here as part of a Holy Land pilgrimage, largely because we wanted to support people on the West Bank.. I'm not sure exactly how much we paid because it was all part of the package. But it was a good 3* level or service. The rooms were fine and there was a room for our group of 26 to have our meeting every evening. There was plenty to suit all tastes at the breakfast and evening buffets. The only two negative features were the fruit juices at breakfast, which were very poor; and the hot beverages, which were just coffee granules at breakfast (the cups being kept separate from the hot water for some reason) or only available at the bar in the evening. The staff were friendly and the business appeared to be Christian-run. The town was bigger than I remember and the centre appeared to be more than easy walking distance away.\n",

      "review_body : I went to the Holy Land in a group tour and we stayed at the Nativity. The staff couldn't be more friendly. They try to speak as many languages as they can, most speak at least some portuguese (my native language). The highlight of the staff is Nichola, who seems to do a bit of everything in the hotel and is always ready to help. My mother fell sick on our last day of stay in the middle of the night. We had about four hours before a very early flight. My mother had a fever and was throwing up. Because of the short time for rest, I tried not to wake up the tour leader. I asked Nicholas for help and he arranged for a doctor that arrived there in 5 minutes, at 1AM. The doctor gave her shots and even gave me a ride to a 24 hours pharmacy for the medicines she would need and thankfully we were able to travel. Nichola was like an angel that night.Also the location is great, lots of shops around, even a very good bakery, a nice bar, a supermarket and a delicious ice cream.\n",

      "review_body : The Roots Hotel is a comfortable hotel close to the beach. I have been staying here a couple of days in January, so not really beach season. Probably because the off-season, the hotel is very quiet. The dining room (smoking allowed) is very spacious. Service is friendly and efficient. The menu is international and portions are large and of reasonable quality.Breakfast is excellent.The rooms are good with beach or sea view.The hotel is located in one of the nicest areas of Gaza and a good starting point for walks along the coastline and to the harbour.\n",

The décor of the hotel is a pleasant surprise for new comers, feeling more akin to a mountain lodge all dressed in wooden and with high ceilings. Rooms are comfortable, wifi works well, and the breakfast is generous. In the evening enjoy a tasty dish from their very long menu. Generator back up power and hot water are guaranteed.\n",

      "review_body : I paid 150 shekels a night for a single room with attached bathroom. Both the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and very spacious. There was a kitchenette with fridge, microwave, counter space with sink, and cupboards for dishes (which the staff will bring you at your request). There is also a supermarket right next door. The bed was very comfortable. Free wi-fi is available (although there are no computers for use, so if you don't have your own device, you will have to look for an internet cafe). Satellite TV in room. 24 hour hot water, although the hot water heater only heats up when the electricity in your room is on, i.e., when you are in the room; this means that you should wait about an hour after entering your room before the water is hot enough for a quick shower. Ramallah was quite cold at night, and the space heater provided did a great job of heating up the room. Complementary breakfast (basic, but good and filling) is provided upstairs in the restaurant. Lunch and dinner are also available either in the restaurant or as room service; I didn't try any meals other than breakfast so I can't comment on the quality, but the selection on the menu was good, although the prices were a little higher than can be found in town.The staff are extremely helpful, friendly, and professional. I arrived at the hotel between midnight and 1am after a long day at the border, and hadn't eaten since breakfast. The staff brought what was basically my complementary breakfast as room service within a half hour of arriving, at no extra charge.The location is not central, but is in a quiet neighbourhood and close to Jasmine Cafe (a trendy-ish shisha cafe that also serves western food). It is about a 20 - 25 minute walk to Manara circle. I would generally take a taxi into town (uphill) and walk back. TIP: if you take a private taxi, such as the ones the hotel offer to get for you, you will pay about 15 shekels to get into town, but if you flag down a shared taxi on the main road, the cost is only 2.5 shekels to town.I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and would recommend it to any traveller.\n",

Because most of my group was arriving in Tel Aviv 8 hours later, I was not looking forward to waiting around the airport. There was one other family in the same situation. Well, the hotel manager, Yuri, arranged for a car to get us right to the hotel after a long trans-atlantic flight. The entire property was modern and had all the amenities you could ever want. The floors glistened with cleanliness. All of the hotel staff went out of their way to do whatever they could to take care of the guests. Regarding the guests, you will find most come from Russia, (as you would expect), but also from all over mostly Eastern Europe. The food was very good, and since breakfast and supper were all served buffet style, it was always easy to find something satisfy all tastes. The hotel packed a box lunch for us to take on our tour bus for every day except for two, when Yuri personally delivered our lunch boxes to where we happened to be touring those two days.I found the rooms to be very spacious, especially since I was a single in a double room. My room (427) had a balcony that overlooked Bethlehem and was quite scenic.You can't beat the location. It's just a five minute walk to the Church of the Nativity and all the shops and restaurants around Manger Square. Even though I was part of a group, it appeared to me that prices were quite reasonable, even if one was not traveling with a group. The wifi was free and the signal was strong in all areas of the property. The general manager, Yuri, is what makes this operation work like clockwork. He will take very good care of you. If you have any needs or concerns, you can be assured that Yuri will do whatever it takes to make things right.For my next trip back to the Holy Land, I will be staying at the Pilgrim Residence for sure.\n",

The room was very good sizes and have all necessary things in it (apart of hairdryers, which you can always ask for in reception). Breakfasts and dinners had a big varieties considering our fasting and non-fasting days and service was fantastic! Nothing to complain about. Everyone can get food according to his/her preferences and taste.\n",

The restaurant has awesome food - their Zebdiye (shrimps cooked in a claypot with a moderately hot tomato sauce) is simply amazing and a must-eat. The inside of the restaurant is lovely, with its fountain, basin, beautiful tiles and old wooden furniture. The outside is also charming with its wooden beds-sofas, its colorful veils hanging from the sofas and its beautiful view on the sea and Gaza's huge Sea Mosque. The rooms lack charm but are comfortable and with seaview. The breakfast was not great, but the staff was extremely nice and efficient. The hotel is located on the outskirts of Gaza City.\n",

      "review_body : Although the rooms were quite small for twin sharing but they were clean. We stayed in this hotel for 5 days/ 4 nights and each day, our room was cleaned and our bed properly made up making us feel like new guests arriving for the first time. There was only one elevator which was small and could carry only few guests. These physical limitations i. e., size of the room and the elevator did not really bother us since we were out most of the time. We only stayed in the hotel to sleep. Besides, the service we received from the hotel personnel were so good that they more than made up for said limitations.The staff were nice and friendly. They were mostly male. Even in the reception, the officer was also a male. Yet they always smiled and were so accommodating. When i needed something like a cup of hot water or adapter, I would just approach any of the staff and immediately my request was acted upon. Our package included breakfast and dinner which were served buffet style. The food consisted of mostly fresh green salad and vegetables and main dishes of chicken and beef or fish. But what i really like about our meal were the fresh fruits as dessert. They were crunchy and juicy! Beverage was also juice from freshly picked fruits. I just loved them! I and my friends enjoyed our stay at Sahara Hotel. We highly recommend it.\n",

The breakfast and dinner are good and well prepared. The staff is hospitable and helpful. The area is guiet. There are supermarket and restaurants near by. Beit Sahour is a beautiful village, especially the old town. Most of the residents are Christians. Sahara has a nice price. We highly recommend the hotel and also the village!\n",
