"To those traveling to the West Bank, be advised that firstly, the culture will be shocking for those who have never been to the Middle East before. It's quite extreme in terms of outside surroundings, even for someone coming from Israel. The standards of this hotel however, do match up with some of the more run-down establishments in the west. Not that the hotel wasn't comfortable, because it was. There was a nice flat panel TV in the room, the bed was comfortable, the room clean, and overall, the staff was very friendly. There were a few problems and for this reason I personally wouldn't go back to to the hotel based on them. They are as follows: The first night of my stay I wanted to take a bath. When I turned the water on, I noticed there was no plug, so I went to phone reception. When I did so, the phone would not call down to the lobby. I had to go downstairs by elevator - which was another irritant to everyone in our group, because the elevator stopped on every single floor even when no one pushed the button. When I reached the ground floor, I told the receptionist the problem with their being no bathtub stopper. For a long time I didn't believe she understood me in English, because she said they didn't have them in the hotel - and that seemed absurd to me. She then finally called the manager, and he confirmed that they in fact do not have bathtub stoppers in the rooms because there is never enough hot water. That would have been a culture shock, only if I had thought for a moment that The Intercontinental down the street might have had the same problem. Which I highly doubt they did/ever do. Then came later that evening, when the phone started working and I called down to have them send up some extra pillows - plus the heater in the room wasn't working and it was freezing. They said someone would be up shortly. A half an hour later, I called down again and the same girl said they were on their way and would be up in five minutes. Another half hour passed, and I called down again only to be told by a man, that he didn't know about any pillows being sent up and in a rather curt tone said, ""We probably don't have any."" And then hung up. I fell asleep around midnight, and shortly thereafter there was a knock at the door - two hours after I'd originally called downstairs. A rather unpleasant man, who didn't even seem like he belonged on staff, had pillows in his hand and handed them to me. When I thanked him, I asked him to come in and look at the heater. He fiddled with the remote for about twenty seconds then threw it down on the bed and said, ""I don't know how it works. You have to ask someone else."" And then walked out the door. The other thing that is important to note about the hotel, is that you can hear ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that is going on outside your door. It's very loud and you feel as though you are in someone's home, rather than a hotel. There is absolutely no sound proof anything going on. My group was there for a conference, so there were over a hundred of us, kids in tow, and you could hear everything in the hallways. I really, really hated that. That's something to definitely factor in if you're considering staying at this hotel.At 5:15 in the morning we were serenaded (note the sarcasm) with Mosque music, and while I understand that's not the hotel's fault, they could have perhaps had better insulation in the windows. While there was no bath for two nights, the heater worked only the second night after one of my roommates managed to figure it out, and there was this run-in with delayed service and an indifferent attitude - I do have to admit that the rest of the staff was very friendly, pleasant and accommodating. I would say though that if given the choice of where to stay, this wouldn't be my first pick as it's not the nicest of places. There was a large buffet of food for dinner, and as far as I know for breakfast as well. Salads, Middle Eastern delicacies galore were all a part of the restaurant's menu both days we were there. I didn't have any of the food provided - but was told by my friends that it was delicious. The towels provided are small and rough. They are not soft at all - imagine shop towels, but less comfortable. They are almost grainy. There were three of us staying in a room (naturally two of the twin beds were pushed together - why, God only knows), and they gave us two tiny bars of soap. All in all I wouldn't deny that this is a comfortable enough establishment, but once again, just not my very first choice. P.S. There was also no toilet brush in the bathroom - just a good tip for you, depending on how you roll.",NEU,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC

We stayed in this hotel during our visit in Bethlehem and the place is really nice esp we have the spacious room on the 4 floor with the excellent view of the sorrounding area of the old town.

I cant find any fault as most of the facilities is relatively good. Food is also good which is being serve in 2 restaurants with a lots of variety to choose from.

In addition the windows could not be shut and feared for the children so we asked them not to go too close to the windows!The parking lot of the hotel is relatively small (only around 10 cars could cramp into the small parking lot of the hotel and we had to ask to move the cars in order to go in/out of the parking lot. (it was not that bad as most of the time we did not have to use the car at all)The TV/entertainment in the hotel is almost not present (the TVs only have a few channels) so bring something for the kids to do (while bathing, etc.)Overall we had a good experience, in order to make it better I suggest to fix/clean the windows, get better children entertainment and improve the parking lot.",P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC

If you wish to dine elsewhere there are a number of small restaurants and cafes near by. The only 'down side' of Bethlehem is the evidence of apartheid in the form of the monstrous wall that has been constructed. As a boy I once saw the Berlin Wall and the wall that the Israelis have contructed is just as disturbing a sight.

A ten minute stroll though the souk will take you to Nativity Square.The rooms are comfortable with air-con, shutters, comfortable beds and a little bit of luxury.

Staying here means helping the Caritas in their work and rising Bethlehems economy. So you get a moderate room with excellent food for a very reasonable price! The more people stay here, the larger the chance for renovations which of course could do some good. Maybe the busdriver needs some special advise, as our bus driver didn’t know the place.Ask for Fr.

If you really want to understand the current state of Israel....you need to stay in the occupied territories and experience what it is like for over half the population. The hotels will make your stay impeccable, while all the work force goes home at night to sub-standard living conditions. Meaning, they will sacrifice their own water intake, their standard of living...to make you feel welcome. This hotel is SAFE. I've stayed here multiple times. There is nothing wrong with the ""environment""...other than Bethlehem is under occupation. The hotel cannot remove the separation wall. Be attentive when you travel to educate yourself past what the newspapers might report. What is the reason all the houses in Occupied Territories have water tanks on the roofs while no water tanks are found in other regions of Israel?? I have walked alone, as a woman, throughout many towns in the Occupied Territories and have never once felt unsafe. In fact, more often than not....a Palestinian has helped me find what I needed to find or directed me to a good place to shop or eat. If you find it a ""hassle"" to be asked into a shop...ask yourself how you would do under occupation in conducting your own business. I am fortunate enough that my children don't have to sell necklaces on the street. As far as the hotel...it is safe, clean, and they will knock themselves out to make your stay comfortable.

"Went there as part of a group, travelling exclusively to places of religious (christian) interest. The location of the hotel is convenient for that, because it is as close as it gets to the entrance of Bethlehem, thus the checkpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem (and the bus stop for the local transportation bus to Jerusalem). So the group's bus didn't get stuck in traffic (finding a queue in the checkpoint is a different story), which made it easier to travel from and to Bethlehem. The main avenue of the city, Manger Street, passes in front of the hotel. However, this means that the hotel is situated in the north edge of the city, so a bit far from the city center and its main attraction, the Church of Nativity. Not particularly recommended to go there on foot, as it will be a bit tiring to return, however if you like walking a good idea would to be to go to the Church of Nativity via Manger street and return via Star street, a picturesque stone paved road.Generally the hotel is not luxurious, however I suppose this must be quite common in the West Bank. The room was quite spacious but basic, clean and generally we didn't have any particular problem. The walls are a bit thin, usually in the corridor one could hear people talking inside the rooms. Prayers from the mosques might wake you up at night if you are not used to travelling in muslim countries. Each room has one key for the door (no card), all keys are left in a basket at the reception and anyone can go and pick up his key on his own from the basket, which made me feel a bit unsafe to be honest. So I wouldn't recommend leaving valuable things unlocked in the room, I kept my luggage locked at all times while I was away from the room. There was no free wifi in the hotel, you have to pay for it per day. Some main satellite channels were available on TV. There is a buffet restaurant in the ground floor, unfortunately cuisine was rather international (obviously due to the fact that there are groups of pilgrims from all over the world staying at the hotel), so I can't say we had the chance to taste local dishes. The staff was polite and helpful. There is a small mini-market shop right next to the hotel, very convenient for buying water and snacks, from early morning till late at night.Generally it is a quite nice, convenient place to stay if you are travelling with a group (or alone, if you are planning on visiting Jerusalem frequently) but is doesn't have anything particular to offer apart from the basics.",NEU,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC
"This hotel in Bethlehem was the closest to good international standards of the 3 in which we stayed during our visit to Israel and Palestine. I understand that the interior is being revamped and I must confess that it appeared in good order though I did not explore beyond the first floor.Our allocated room was of a reasonable size with comfortable beds and both it and the bathroom were very clean.The evening meal was again buffet-style in a large dining room. Many of the tables were marked as reserved for parties from all quarters of the globe, but we were in early and got first dibs at the food on offer. It was prepared to a very good standard, and as usual with buffets, you could go back repeatedly until you burst. No-one actually went that far while we were there.So why only four stars? Well, the waiters were obviously preoccupied and not very communicative. They dished out watermelon desert on a 'take it or leave it"" basis. Well, everyone is entitled to an off-lay I guess, and maybe they will be better next time.Breakfast was pretty good too, though our relatively early start meant that I only saw it through bleary eyes.

There were two hot mains and this was the only hot food that there was available to choose from. Both were very nice but if you are a picky eater, had children, or you're vegetarian, you might have struggled as both were slowly cooked meat in sauce/gravy, with either rice or potatoes.

The hotel is located quite a way out of Bethlehem and there's nowhere nearby to eat so you're stuck with an awful buffet in the hotel dining room with (literally) several hundred fellow guests, most of whom I guess are on a package tour. Public areas of the hotel - e.g. reception and bar - are full of tour groups milling around and smoking and shouting at each other in the bar.

"First of all, my apology to the hotel staff, they did their best but unfortunately the overall experience was bad, very bad. I don't know if this poor outcome was because of this time in the season with lack of tourists, but my recommendation to the hotel owners to close the gate if they offer this kind of service to their visitors, even if they are the only guests!!After I went through most of the reviews here and got the impression of good hotel, I booked for 2 connected rooms for 2 nights stay with my family (2 adults and 4 children). We arrived at noon. My first impression was: ""wait.. where is everybody? I don't see any guests here"". Then we got out rooms at the 5th floor, but the next room was under renovations, and I felt that may cause some noise, so I asked the reception girl to let us move to different floor. She was nice and we moved to 2nd floor.The rooms size was ok, but that where it ends. The beds was in bad condition, no children channels in the tv, the hot water was on demand (yes! only after we called the reception we were able to get a hot bath), the babies beds was not suitable for kids sleep!! Already at midnight we decided to cancel the 2nd night and get back home early in the morning.Then the morning has arrived. We went to restaurant floor to get some breakfast at ~8:30AM, but all of the sudden the lights was off and some staff women asks us if ""you want to eat breakfast?"" !!! I asked her: ""are there any guests in the hotel anyway?"" She replied: ""only you""!! Then some guy made for us some eggs and few things!! of-course we couldn't eat anything because we already lost our appetite. Again, I don't blame the hotel staff but the owners who let these level of service happen to people who paid for it!!Immediately after this horrible experience, we collected our things, went down to the reception, cancel the 2nd night, paid whatever we had to pay for, and got out of there.

The beds very comfortable with short small size satin sheets, a big cupboard occupied so much of space hence no space for any chairs in the room.,but the big sliding glass door to the balcony gave a spacious feeling .. unfortunately this beautiful balcony was dusty & had units of A/C of other rooms.The shower cubicle small but, at least we could turn around & there was place for keeping toiletteries. had good quality of supplies & even a hair dryer.. on the whole enjoyed quality sleep and very clean with fresh towels everyday.Regarding meals, the breakfast okay but dinner terrible, dinning area resembled a hostel dinning hall, no decor no windows very claustrophobic as it was in the basement...hopefully it was a make shift arrangement as the hotel seems like it had had no time for the finishing touches.Reception great has a beautiful mosaic picture of the sheperds.Best thing we did from this hotel is one evening, some of us after the days tour, refreshed & took a cab to the Manger square at sixish & the same cab collected us at 8 pm for only 10 us dollars , not per person!!! We thouroughly enjoyed the Manger square atmosphere, shopped to our heart's content, the prices were half the marked as there was no tour guide along, thats what the shop owners told us, please contact Saliba Bandak 38 Milk grotto street, has nice icons & good stuff & good prices but without the guide, thats how we got to know of the commissions.And moreso such a beautiful feeling in the square, calm & peaceful,when illuminated one see''s the crosses of all shapes--,Greek orthodox, R catholic & the Armenian.We also met some local people & tasted local food, we tried backlava from a street vendor. Dont miss this outting, even though the guides advice you against this & give you all sorts of excuses of shops being shut, unsafe etc. please experience the good vibes & shop at ease .

"We had traveled as a big group for a Holy Land trip to Egypt and Israel with the help of Silverhearts Travel. We were scheduled to spend the 7th day and the 8th day of the safari in Bethlehem. We arrived in Bethlehem excited on the eve of 19th Sept. 2014 after a whole day tour in Galilee and were received well, the potters even offered to carry our bags to our rooms. We were excited when we found out that our room was very spacious, clean and nice. It was a corner room. The only issue was that it was a bit noisy. We could hear the vehicles zooming up the hill. We called and request for a change of room. The reservation guy was very kind enough and allowed us to change our room. We got another quieter, clean room with good working AC and a fridge to cool some milk we had bought in a supermarket in Bethlehem. The dinner was great that night. They also offered us huge apple fruit. The apples were so nice, we requested for some more so that we could carry into the room which they offered gladly. The waiter's that night were friendly we even chatted with them. After dinner we decided to relax at their roof top lounge/restaurant for a moment but it was a bit windy and cold. We requested for a warm glass of water. We were directed to the bar downstairs where we were kindly offered warm water in a glass.The staff were friendly and welcoming but it was only for that night. The following morning the breakfast was not all that. We later left for our day tour. We came in the evening for dinner tired after our day tour in Bethlehem. We found new waiters that night on 20th Sept. The waiters were not friendly. I remember we arrived a bit late after refreshing in our room only to find a few things remaining for dinner While enjoying our dinner, the waiter started preparing the tables for the following day. One of the waiters seems to have been very tired and angered by something. He kept on placing the cutlery and plates on the tables with a bang to teh extent that he kept on interrupting our conversation. He even broke some glasses in our site. Thanks to God! he was a bit far from us. The starter soup was wanting. Only 1cold cup remained. As a gentleman i offered to give it to my wife since she comes first as far my priorities are concerned. We requested the chef of the day to warm the cold soup for my wife and also to make another hot one for me. We were shocked to find out that the chef added 1 cup of water and corn starch to the cold one to make it 2, proceeded to warm it with microwave...i wish you were there to taste. It tasted horrible. We kept it aside and humbly went for the main course which was also one of the the worst during our whole safari. It was badly done, no varieties but same old, no creativity invested in the preparation of the dinner.

"This was the find of the century when it comes to hidden gems..This rather bizzare hotel is situated on the outskirts of Bethlehem in the Palestinian Territories. I stayed there one night having found it on booking.com for around £45 ($70US). Its difficult to find and is down a dirt track on the edge of Bethlehem and a good 10 minute car journey from Manger Square at the centre of Bethlehem (you couldn't walk it). Also there is absolutely nothing else around here other than the hotel itself.But thats the only downside. I turned up to a set of electronic security gates. I was greeted by the security guard whilst another member of staff took my luggage and then parked my car. Real 5 star stuff this!Walked into reception and was given a free drink whilst they sorted my room key. I was escorted to my room along with a waiter who followed me with a pot of coffee for the room.The room itself was first class. Great air con. International satellite TV, a stunnig view of Bethlehem from the balcony, Huge bed. All for $70! Now this place does describe itself as a resort. It had a massive swimming pool with water slides, (no water in the pool though but im guessing its because it was winter) Saunas, turkish baths, childrens playgrounds etc.. But here is the bad news.Me and my two friends were the ONLY people staying there!And my $70 probably didnt even cover the cost of the electric lights they had on that evening.I think the main problem the resort has is first of all no locals are likely to stay there (although there was a great wedding party on in the bar that evening for a local family).Secondly most foreign tourists are bussed in and out of Bethlehem and do not spend the night there which is a great shame.So if you really want to see Bethlehem stay the night in the town and make sure you stay at the Murad. It needs your support and is really trying to make a go of things in a difficult area.(check out the Peace Wall 100 yards from the Hotel).Having said this I am guessing that its alot more buzzy in the height of the Summer.

"The economic squeeze on Palestine continues to tighten (a law is even being promulgated which would ban visitors to Israel from staying a night in Palestine), so it's not fair to grade the Grand as though it were in Jerusalem or Tiberias; so I'll keep my criticisms to those things which could be rectified by management rather than cash. Firstly, the service is first-class: very friendly indeed, and caring of its customers. Main public facilities are excellent -- especially the large lobby area, the bar, the conference room, and third-floor restaurant. As everywhere in this region there is so much fresh fruit and veg that breakfast is a delight (although the hot offering -- sour beans and sausages -- won't be to everyone's liking). Oddly, the sixty-plus guests in the dining room served themselves coffee from a single jug on a warming plate -- it didn't last three minutes.Secondly, the location is ideal, right in the middle of the bustling narrow streets, and easy walking distance to the main tourist sights. The locals are immensely friendly. Thirdly, if you're a smoker (as I am) you'll be pleased to be able to get a smoking room and even to smoke in the lounge -- that won't sound like good news to non-smokers, but somehow the residual smell of tobacco doesn't linger (and most visitors go outside to smoke anyway).Given the pleasantness described above, my room was disappointing. On the plus-side It was a good size, with a very comfortable double bed; and there were electricity sockets aplenty. However, I had to physically move the TV to create a work-space; no bath plug, so no bath; an entrance door that wouldn't stay shut unless locked; coffee not replenished; the hot water took an unusually long time to come through. These are management lapses, not the consequence of diminished cashflow.However, all-in-all the establishment and its location were so charming that I'll be staying there again.",P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC

"We (my wife daughter and myself) visited Egypt, Israel and Jordan as part a 30 member group from Chennai India. We stayed in Nativity Hotel from 3rd to 6th nights of our tour for 4 nights. First of all the name is Nativity Hotel and not Nativity Bells hotel( I don’t know if there is a Nativity Bells hotel somewhere else in Bethlehem)Location wise the Hotel is situated on a busy road. The décor was impressive, the rooms and bathrooms were very big and spacious, free wifi was available in the lobby, the cleanliness of the hotel and rooms was amazing and to top it all there was a really fantastic departmental store within a stones throw away where you can get everything from bottled water, fresh breads,fresh cakes, sweets, fresh juices , cool drinks, ice creams etc etc at local prices not tourist prices. This store was a real Godsend for tourists like us who are forced to shell out huge amounts for savouring the local flavours. Next to this store is a textile store which also has a number of t shirts, and ready made garments at throw away prices. The only negative about this hotel was that the food menu for breakfast and dinner remained practically unchanged throughout the duration of our stay there resulting in a monotonous diet for us. We had some time leftover in the evening and decided to visit the shops near the Church of Nativity for some local food and shopping. A taxi ride costs roughly 20 shekels from the hotel. The prices of souvenirs and gift items in Bethlehem are almost half the rates compared with the shops in Jerusalem. I strongly advise you to buy all gift items and souvenirs at Bethlehem itself if you have a chance to do so. And I can tell you Bethlehem is a very safe place(at least at the time of my visit) to go around the town by night to do some last minute shopping. The people here are extremely friendly and respect tourists especially when you are accompanied by family. I want to inform you that most of the buses and hotels in Israel are wi fi enabled so if you have a good smartphone and the persons you want to contact are also having a smartphone, you can communicate via viber or other apps. No need to spend for an international calling card. To sum up Nativity Hotel is a very good choice to stay in Bethlehem and I am sure that you will thoroughly enjoy yourself if you choose to do so.",P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC

Just up the hill from the hotel is a small store, ATM, and a cut through that let's you walk right onto Star Street and a five minute walk to Nativity Square.

"I spent 4 nights at the Nativity Bells Hotel in September. I can recommend this hotel for its nice rooms and friendly service. There is construction noise during the day since the hotel is not finished. Floors 5-7 are being completed, so I recommend staying on the first or second floor if you're there during the day. Personally I like to nap in the afternoon, and this would not be possible on floors 3 or 4. There is some dust in the elevator and common areas due to the ongoing construction. The Bethlehem sights are about 10' away, which makes the hotel a convenient option. Since the hotel is not far from the shared taxi departure point it's a good base for visiting the West Bank. I went to Hebron, Ramallah, Jericho, and Herodium this way. Since the hotel caters to groups, try to get an end room or you are liable to be in the middle of lots of boring conversations going on right outside your door. Finally I will mention that the hotel is Christian owned and that Bethlehem has a significant Christian minority.

Hello i stayed here as part of a group of 26. On a pilgrimage to the holy land. The rooms we had were all on the upper floors (floor 7) and all had great view from the windows. Rooms were brand new and very clean. Bedding was excellent and room facilities included tv. Air con that if it goes off just call reception and for some funny reason they can control it ??We were staying half board which included buffet breakfast and buffet dinner. Yes the food was good but to be honest after 2 days it just became repetitive with just the odd thing being changed but it was more or less the same. I could not fault it though and all the guys that serve in the restaurant gave excellent customer service. The hotel is non smoking in the rooms which i appreciated as a non smoker. And your rooms have a Mosquitos mesh on them so if you don't like air con you can at least open the window and not be eaten alive.Location is great just turn left out of the hotel and you will find a great souvenir shop i cant give you the name as that would be unfair to the other shops but look for a red rose and ask for George. Tell him mike from London sent you and he is a star. Keep walking to the bottom of the hill and your in the town and the markets are all around you. Be safe and stay together and watch your wallets and pockets at all times.all in all it was a great hotel and i will stay again on my return to the holy land.

Food was ok, it wasn't 5 star but nor was the hotel. We never went hungry.....breakfast was a choice of various salads, meat, boiled eggs, 2 days we got scrambled eggs which was a welcoming change! Toast/bread with various jams/spreads. Juice, tea/coffe and cereal and fruit, as much as you liked. Evening meal again, buffet style, plenty of salads, choice of usually 2 meats, rice, vegetables, potatoes and fresh fruit. The dining room was on the 8th floor with panoramic views of the whole of Bethlehem, outstanding! Showers were very powerful and hot water was plentiful. Air con in all rooms and was exceptional (included in price of stay, no extra charge) Staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a safety deposit box service but didn't use it.The hotel itself is not on a massive hill, yes it's a bit of a climb, but Bethlehem is not a flat town, it's all on a hill apart from Manger Square. The only downside for me, and it's not really a criticism, but the town seems very dirty, lots of graffiti everywhere and a lot of rubbish discarded in the streets, but apart from that, we loved the hotel and the town itself. Please remember, usually, if you are travelling to places like this, then you will probably be travelling as a pilgrim and not on holiday so don't expect a holiday resort!!The pictures that have been put on here from previous reviews are not doing the hotel justice.

"We stayed for one night since we were guests at a wedding hosted at this hotel. The property had only been open for 7-8 months so everything was new and clean. Our room had two twin beds rather than a queen or king so that was disappointing. Otherwise the owners made a wise choice with the tile floors in the rooms, which will withstand the test of time and always look new. The bathroom was spacious with a great shower that didn't flood the bathroom, a rarity in the Middle East and Europe. We missed breakfast because it ended rather early (9:30 if memory serves) and wifi was tragically slow. I was able to get an LTE signal on my iPhone from a local carrier that was infinitely faster. This is the best hotel in Bethlehem by Western standards - I have stayed at 2 other hotels here - with the only caveat being its location.

The staff couldn't have been more helpful and like Palestinians everywhere, they were all unbelievably friendly.Pretty much anyone going to Gaza is going there with the UN or other aid organisations and will not be surprised but in case the borders get opened anytime soon I'll add a few things people should realise before checking in.Gaza's water situation is dire, so expect a brackish shower and use bottled water to brush your teeth. You'll be a million times better off for water than anyone who lives in Gaza but just don't drink it.Sewage treatment in Gaza has been difficult to say the least since the Israeli bombardment destroyed the treatment plant so you also need to bin your TP as much as possible rather than flushing it.That covered the room was huge, bathroom was spotless and beds comfortable and there was a tonne of satellite TV channels available in room. Most of the rooms have views over Gaza beach and the beautiful Mediterranean.The staff will help with anything you need and despite the difficulties everyone living in Gaza faces, the service here is better than anywhere.

The rooms are clean, well appointed, and comfortable - cool in summer and warm in winter. Everything you need is at hand. Bathrooms are spacious, but the Deira can't escape the fact that it is in Gaza and so the water is saline.Due to Gaza's poor electricity supply, a huge generator ran right outside my window the whole time I was there, but it meant that I had unimpinged electricity.

"The Al Deira is a favourite for journalists and some NGO folks as it is considered safe (e.g. from strikes as the Israelis have the coordinates and therefore do not target). That is important. The hotel itself is quite pricey, despite being in Gaza city, largely because of what I noted above. So firstly, we stayed in room 13 which is considered a suite. There were 2 bedrooms, a large living area and okay sized bathroom and a loft area upstairs which really was more of a waste of space (possible you could sleep more people up there). There was also a fridge but not a kitchenette. There is wi-fi in the room but you need to be patient as it is not consistent. There is a restaurant which is facing the sea and has fairly decent food. There are downsides to the hotel and I will mention a few here. Breakfast in the morning will really depend on the number of people staying--the more people, they do a buffet. If not, then they give you a standard plate of eggs and some bread and you need to ask for extras. It is fine, but getting a waiter to take an order can be a chore as in the morning, they seem to be permanently understaffed. In the evening, the restaurant buzzes and service much better and okay food. The staff in general, are very good. However, one thing to note is that if you get a room facing the main road it is crazy noisy, so try and get one to the back. 13 has one room which is large and faces the front and one that is smaller that is a bit protected from the street noise. It can be very loud, so again if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs and request a backroom. Also note that the wi-fi is not free, except for the restaurant. Otherwise, it is $5 a day.

The epitome of ""hospitable"".I think this hotel is a good, solid, safe, affordable choice when visiting Bethlehem.Best thing about my stay: The owners' son offered to give me a ride (about a kilometer) to where I needed to get the local bus back to Jerusalem on the morning of my check-out.

If we wished for anything, Ivana did her best to provide. The lobby was nicely renovated and was a comfortable place to meet other guests in the evening.

There was no toilet paper at all and the bathroom door handle was missing?! The whole hotel was freezing cold with a room heater that was either off or stuck at 28 degrees with no adjustment, this would explain the receptionist (the only member of staff on site) wearing their coat!!The water and juice bottles supplied at breakfast were opened and part empty, again suggesting they were not fresh. On raising our concerns with the receptionist we were told the bottled water had been refilled with tap water which was fresh and that was an appropriate local practice??!

We didn't try the breakfast.A definite plus was the receptionist, he was really kind and gave us lots of advice and offered us free coffee and tea upon checkout as we didn't make it in time to have breakfast.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable; staff were extremely friendly and helpful; the off-street parking easily accessible; the wifi in the rooms had a strong signal; and, the noise at night was minimal despite being opposite a busy bus terminal.Some things that could improve include: trying to limit the smoking in the lobby/bar area (although this is a problem all over the ME); and, having at least one English language TV channel - such as BBC or al-Jezeera.

I reported to the reception and even if they promised it was not fixed in the next evening. Then they give us another promise that our room will be changed the next day, since no other rooms are available at present. When we reached next day evening I went to the reception to know the new room number. But they are saying that the problem is fixed and we can continue on the same room itself. But when we checked the toilet nothing is fixed and its condition is worse to its extreme. We were not able to use the toilet properly for the last two days and so we were suffereing like hell. On the first day they were trying to blame us saying that we put the toilet papers on the flush and so the problem arised. But we are facing this problem even before we actually using this toilet. Then I went to the reception and said, but they are still saying that no other rooms are availble now. Then I shouted with them and they immediately given us a new room.

"Came as part of a group. Nice clean and airy hotel. The main entrance leads almost straight onto Manger Sq and church of the Nativity. Room was a reasonable size, bathroom decent, everything was clean and the plated meal we got for our late arrival was great. Dining room on floor 6 was good. Loved the choice of breakfast, the hummus is delicious, there was something for everyone from an English/continental breakfast to a middle eastern style. Dinner was good too, lots of choice. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Bar was good - definitely a good hotel to stay in if you want to be comfortable and clean. No evidence of rooftop swimming pool but we didn't have much time for that.

You can't avoid the hills - they're partly what give Ramallah its exceptional climate and perfect summer evenings - but you can walk to all three easily in 10 minutes or so.Hotel itself is well run, rooms clean, balcony brilliant (at front, but noise tolerable, at least on 4th floor), shower good, tea/coffee-making facilities useful (I had single room, not really equipped for preparing a meal), and wifi OK though sometimes temperamental. Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop. Also useful is the car service to and from Tel Aviv Airport - the 350 ILS can be undercut, but the convenience seems worth it.Staff friendly and helpful, with (mostly) pretty good English - AND, leaving perhaps the best to last, it's right next door to Sangria's, which has to be the most enjoyable summer evening hang-out in the city.

Buffet breakfast, usefully served from 7, is varied and adequate, if a bit short on the fruit - disappointing, considering its ready availability - and particularly pleasant taken in the glass-fronted section of the Vintage cafe/coffee shop.

"I paid 150 shekels a night for a single room with attached bathroom. Both the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and very spacious. There was a kitchenette with fridge, microwave, counter space with sink, and cupboards for dishes (which the staff will bring you at your request). There is also a supermarket right next door. The bed was very comfortable. Free wi-fi is available (although there are no computers for use, so if you don't have your own device, you will have to look for an internet cafe). Satellite TV in room. 24 hour hot water, although the hot water heater only heats up when the electricity in your room is on, i.e., when you are in the room; this means that you should wait about an hour after entering your room before the water is hot enough for a quick shower. Ramallah was quite cold at night, and the space heater provided did a great job of heating up the room. Complementary breakfast (basic, but good and filling) is provided upstairs in the restaurant. Lunch and dinner are also available either in the restaurant or as room service; I didn't try any meals other than breakfast so I can't comment on the quality, but the selection on the menu was good, although the prices were a little higher than can be found in town.The staff are extremely helpful, friendly, and professional. I arrived at the hotel between midnight and 1am after a long day at the border, and hadn't eaten since breakfast. The staff brought what was basically my complementary breakfast as room service within a half hour of arriving, at no extra charge.The location is not central, but is in a quiet neighbourhood and close to Jasmine Cafe (a trendy-ish shisha cafe that also serves western food). It is about a 20 - 25 minute walk to Manara circle. I would generally take a taxi into town (uphill) and walk back. TIP: if you take a private taxi, such as the ones the hotel offer to get for you, you will pay about 15 shekels to get into town, but if you flag down a shared taxi on the main road, the cost is only 2.5 shekels to town.I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and would recommend it to any traveller.",P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC

"I had a single accommodation within a group of about 50 during the month of October. I could not have had a a better experience if I had scripted it all out well in advance. Because most of my group was arriving in Tel Aviv 8 hours later, I was not looking forward to waiting around the airport. There was one other family in the same situation. Well, the hotel manager, Yuri, arranged for a car to get us right to the hotel after a long trans-atlantic flight. The entire property was modern and had all the amenities you could ever want. The floors glistened with cleanliness. All of the hotel staff went out of their way to do whatever they could to take care of the guests. Regarding the guests, you will find most come from Russia, (as you would expect), but also from all over mostly Eastern Europe. The food was very good, and since breakfast and supper were all served buffet style, it was always easy to find something satisfy all tastes. The hotel packed a box lunch for us to take on our tour bus for every day except for two, when Yuri personally delivered our lunch boxes to where we happened to be touring those two days.I found the rooms to be very spacious, especially since I was a single in a double room. My room (427) had a balcony that overlooked Bethlehem and was quite scenic.You can't beat the location. It's just a five minute walk to the Church of the Nativity and all the shops and restaurants around Manger Square. Even though I was part of a group, it appeared to me that prices were quite reasonable, even if one was not traveling with a group. The wifi was free and the signal was strong in all areas of the property. The general manager, Yuri, is what makes this operation work like clockwork. He will take very good care of you. If you have any needs or concerns, you can be assured that Yuri will do whatever it takes to make things right.For my next trip back to the Holy Land, I will be staying at the Pilgrim Residence for sure.",P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86,NONIRONIC
